The Schwarzschild metric is an example of a highly symmetric spacetime. It has
continuous symmetries in space (under rotation) and in time (under translation
in time). In addition, it has discrete symmetries under spatial reflection and
time reversal. In section \ref{sec:schwarzschild-orbits}, we saw that the two
continuous symmetries led to the existence of conserved quantities for the trajectories
of test particles, and that these could be interpreted as mass-energy and angular momentum.

Generalizing, we want to consider the idea that a metric may be invariant
when every point in spacetime is systematically shifted by some infinitesimal
amount. For example, the Schwarzschild metric is invariant under $t\rightarrow t+\der t$.
In coordinates $(x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3)=(t,r,\theta,\phi)$, we have a vector field  $(\der t,0,0,0)$
that defines the time-translation symmetry, and it is conventional to split this into
two factors, a finite vector field
$\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and an infinitesimal scalar, so that the displacement vector is
\begin{equation*}
  \boldsymbol{\xi}\der t = (1,0,0,0)\der t\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Such a field is called a Killing vector field, or simply a Killing
vector, after Wilhelm Killing. When all the points in a space are displaced as specified by the Killing vector, they flow without expansion
or compression. The path of a particular point, such as the dashed line in figure \figref{killing-vector}, under this flow is called
its orbit.\index{orbit!Killing vector}\index{Killing vector!orbit} Although the term ``Killing vector'' is singular, it refers to the
entire field of vectors, each of which differs in general from the others. For example, the $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ shown in figure \figref{killing-vector} has a greater
magnitude than a $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ near the neck of the surface.

The infinitesimal notation is designed to describe a continuous symmetry, not a discrete one. For example, the Schwarzschild spacetime
also has a discrete time-reversal symmetry $t \rightarrow -t$. This can't be described by a Killing vector, because the
displacement in time is not infinitesimal.

\begin{eg}{The Euclidean plane}\label{eg:euclidean-killing}
The Euclidean plane has two Killing vectors corresponding to translation in two linearly independent directions, plus
a third Killing vector for rotation about some arbitrarily chosen origin O. In Cartesian coordinates, one way of writing a complete
set of these is is
\begin{align*}
  \boldsymbol{\xi}_1 &= (1,0) \\
  \boldsymbol{\xi}_2 &= (0,1) \\
  \boldsymbol{\xi}_3 &= (-y,x)\eqquad.
\end{align*}
A theorem from classical geometry\footnote{Coxeter, \emph{Introduction to Geometry}, ch.~3} states that any transformation in the Euclidean plane that preserves distances
and handedness can be expressed either as a translation or as a rotation about some point. The transformations that
do not preserve handedness, such as reflections, are discrete, not continuous. This theorem tells us that there are no
more Killing vectors to be found beyond these three, since any translation can be accomplished using $\boldsymbol{\xi}_1$
and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_2$, while a rotation about a point P can be done by translating P to O, rotating, and then
translating O back to P.
\end{eg}

In the example of the Schwarzschild spacetime, the components
of the metric happened to be independent of $t$ when expressed in our coordinates.
This is a sufficient condition for the existence of a Killing vector, but not a necessary one.
For example, it is possible to write the metric of the Euclidean plane in various forms such as
$\der s^2=\der x^2+\der y^2$ and $\der s^2=\der r^2+r^2\der\phi^2$. The first form is independent of
$x$ and $y$, which demonstrates that $x\rightarrow x+\der x$ and $y\rightarrow y+\der y$
are Killing vectors, while the second form gives us $\phi\rightarrow \phi+\der\phi$.
Although we may be able to find a particular coordinate system in which the existence of a Killing vector is manifest,
its existence is an intrinsic property that holds regardless of whether we even employ coordinates.
In general, we define a Killing vector not in terms of a particular
system of coordinates but in purely geometrical terms: a space has a Killing vector $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ if translation by
an infinitesimal amount $\boldsymbol{\xi}\der u$ doesn't change the distance between nearby points.
Statements such as ``the spacetime has a timelike Killing vector''
are therefore intrinsic, since both the timelike property and the property of being a Killing vector are
coordinate-independent.

Killing vectors, like all vectors, have to live in some kind of vector space. On a manifold, this vector
space is particular to a given point, figure \figref{tangent-space}. A different vector space exists at
every point, so that vectors at different points, occupying different spaces, can be compared
only by parallel transport. Furthermore, we really have \emph{two} such spaces at a given point,
a space of contravariant vectors and a space of covariant ones. These are referred to as the
tangent and cotangent spaces.\index{tangent vector}\label{tangent-space}% index entry for tangent space is a cross ref
The infinitesimal displacements
we've been discussing belong to the contravariant (upper-index) space, but by lowering and index
we can just as well discuss them as covariant vectors. The customary way of notating Killing vectors
makes use of the fact, mentioned in passing on p.~\pageref{partials-as-basis-of-tangent-space},
that the partial derivative operators
${\partial_0,\partial_1,\partial_2,\partial_3}$ form the basis for a vector space.
In this notation,
the Killing vector of the Schwarzschild metric we've been discussing can be notated simply as
\begin{equation*}
      \boldsymbol{\xi} =  \partial_t\eqquad.
\end{equation*}

The partial derivative notation, like the infinitesimal notation, implicitly refers to continuous symmetries rather than discrete ones.
If a discrete symmetry carries a point $\zu{P}_1$ to some distant point $\zu{P}_2$, then $\zu{P}_1$ and $\zu{P}_2$
have two different tangent planes, so there is not a uniquely defined notion
of whether vectors $\boldsymbol{\xi}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_2$ at these two points are equal --- or even approximately equal. 
There can therefore be no well-defined way to construe a statement such as, ``$\zu{P}_1$ and $\zu{P}_2$
are separated by a displacement $\boldsymbol{\xi}$.'' In the case of a
continuous symmetry, on the other hand, the two tangent planes come closer and closer to coinciding as the distance $s$ between
two points on an orbit approaches zero, and in this limit we recover an approximate notion of being able to
compare vectors in the two tangent planes. They can be compared by parallel transport, and although parallel
transport is path-dependent, the difference bewteen paths is proportional to the area they enclose,
which varies as $s^2$, and therefore becomes negligible in the limit $s\rightarrow0$.

Self-check: Find another Killing vector of the Schwarzschild metric, and express it in the tangent-vector notation.


It can be shown that an equivalent condition for a field to be a Killing vector is $\nabla_a \boldsymbol{\xi}_b+\nabla_b \boldsymbol{\xi}_a = 0$.
This relation, called the Killing equation,\index{Killing equation}
is written without reference to any coordinate system, in keeping with the coordinate-independence of the notion.

When a spacetime has more than one Killing vector, any linear combination of them is also a Killing vector.
This means that although the existence of certain types of Killing vectors may be intrinsic, the exact
choice of those vectors is not. 

\begin{eg}{Euclidean translations}
The Euclidean plane has two translational Killing vectors $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$, i.e., $\partial_x$ and $\partial_y$. 
These same vectors could be expressed as $(1,1)$ and $(1,-1)$ in coordinate system that was rescaled and
rotated by 45 degrees.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{A cylinder}\label{eg:cylinder-killing}
The local properties of a cylinder, such as intrinsic flatness, are the same as the local properties of
a Euclidean plane. Since the definition of a Killing vector is local and intrinsic, a cylinder has
the same three Killing vectors as a plane, if we consider only a patch on the cylinder that is small enough so
that it doesn't wrap all the way around. However, only two of these --- the translations ---
can be extended to form a smooth vector field on the entire surface of the cylinder.
These might be more naturally notated in $(\phi,z)$ coordinates
rather than $(x,y)$, giving $\partial_z$ and $\partial_\phi$.

\begin{eg}{A sphere}\label{eg:sphere-killing}
A sphere is like a plane or a cylinder in that it is a two-dimensional space in which no point has
any properties that are intrinsically different than any other. We might expect, then, that it would
have two Killing vectors. Actually it has three, $\boldsymbol{\xi}_x$, $\boldsymbol{\xi}_y$, and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_z$, corresponding to
infinitesimal rotations about the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. To show that these are all independent Killing
vectors, we need to demonstrate that we can't, for example, have $\boldsymbol{\xi}_x=c_1\boldsymbol{\xi}_y+c_2\boldsymbol{\xi}_z$ for some
constants $c_1$ and $c_2$. To see this, consider the actions of $\boldsymbol{\xi}_y$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_z$ on the point $P$ where
the $x$ axis intersects the sphere. (References to the axes and their intersection with the sphere are
extrinsic, but this is only for convenience of description and visualization.) Both $\boldsymbol{\xi}_y$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_z$
move P around a little, and these motions are in orthogonal directions, wherease $\boldsymbol{\xi}_x$ leaves P fixed.
This proves that we can't have $\boldsymbol{\xi}_x=c_1\boldsymbol{\xi}_y+c_2\boldsymbol{\xi}_z$. All three Killing vectors are linearly independent.

This example shows that linear independence of Killing vectors can't be visualized simply by thinking about
the vectors in the tangent plane at one point. If that were the case, then we could have at most two
linearly independent Killing vectors in this two-dimensional space. When we say ``Killing vector'' we're really referring to the
Killing vector \emph{field}, which is defined everywhere on the space.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Proving nonexistence of Killing vectors}
\egquestion Find all Killing vectors of these two metrics:
\begin{align*}
\der s^2 &= e^{-x}\der x^2+e^x\der y^2 \\
\der s^2 &= \der x^2+x^2\der y^2\eqquad.
\end{align*}

\eganswer Since both metrics are manifestly independent of $y$, it follows that $\partial_y$ is a Killing vector for both of them.
Neither one has any other manifest symmetry, so we can reasonably conjecture that this is the only Killing vector either one of
them has. However, one can have symmetries that are not manifest, so it is also possible that there are more.

One way to attack
this would be to use the Killing equation to find a system of differential equations, and then determine how many linearly
independent solutions there were.

But there is a simpler approach. The dependence of these metrics on $x$ suggests
that the spaces may have intrinsic properties that depend on $x$; if so, then this demonstrates a lower symmetry
than that of the Euclidean plane, which has three Killing vectors. One intrinsic property we can check is the scalar
curvature $R$. The following Maxima code calculates $R$ for the first metric.

\begin{listing}{1}
load(ctensor);
dim:2;
ct_coords:[x,y];
lg:matrix([exp(-x),0],[0,exp(x)]);
cmetric();
R:scurvature(); /* scalar curvature */
\end{listing}
% killing.mac

The result is $R=-e^x$, which demonstrates that points that differ in $x$ have different intrinsic properties.
Since the flow of a Killing field $\xi$ can never connect points that have different properties, we conclude
that $\xi_x=0$. If only $\xi_y$ can be nonzero, the Killing equation $\nabla_a \xi_b+\nabla_b \xi_a = 0$
simplifies to $\nabla_x\xi_y=\nabla_y\xi_y=0$. These equations constrain both $\partial_x\xi_y$
and $\partial_y\xi_y$, which means that given a value of $\xi_y$ at some point in the plane,
its value everywhere else is determined. Therefore the only possible Killing vectors are scalar multiples of the Killing vector already found.
Since we don't consider Killing vectors to be distinct unless they are linearly independent, the first metric only has one Killing vector.

A similar calculation for the second metric shows that $R=0$, and an explicit calculation of its Riemann tensor shows that
in fact the space is flat. It is simply the Euclidean plane written in funny coordinates. This metric has the same three
Killing vectors as the Euclidean plane. 

It would have been tempting to leap to the wrong conclusion about the second metric by the following
reasoning. The signature of a metric is an intrinsic property. The metric has signature $++$ everywhere in the plane
except on the $y$ axis, where it has signature $+0$. This shows that the $y$ axis has different intrinsic properties than
the rest of the plane, and therefore the metric must have a lower symmetry than the Euclidean plane. It can have at most
two Killing vectors, not three. This contradicts our earlier conclusion. The resolution of this paradox is that
this metric has a removable degeneracy of the same type as the one described in section \ref{sec:degeneracy}.
As discussed in that section, the signature is invariant only under \emph{nonsingular} transformations, but the
transformation that converts these coordinates to Cartesian ones is singular.
\end{eg}

<% begin_sec("Inappropriate mixing of notational systems") %>
Confusingly, it is customary to express vectors and dual vectors by summing over basis vectors
like this:\label{abuse-of-notation}
\begin{align*}
  \vc{v} &= v^\mu \partial_\mu \\
  \boldsymbol{\omega} &= \omega_\mu \der x^\mu\eqquad.
\end{align*}
This is an abuse of notation, driven by the desire to have up-down pairs of indices to sum
according to the usual rules of the Einstein notation convention. But by that convention, a quantity like
$\vc{v}$ or $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ with no indices is a scalar, and that's not the case here. The
products on the right are not tensor products, i.e., the indices aren't being contracted.

This muddle is the result of trying to make the
Einstein notation do too many things at once and of trying to preserve a clumsy and outdated system of notation and
terminology originated by Sylvester in 1853. 
In pure abstract index notation, there are not
six flavors of objects as in the two equations above but only two: vectors like $v^a$ and dual vectors
like $\omega_a$. The Sylvester notation is the prevalent one among
mathematicians today, because their predecessors committed themselves to it a century before the
development of alternatives like abstract index notation and birdtracks. The Sylvester system is inconsistent with
the way physicists today think of vectors and dual vectors as being defined by their transformation
properties, because Sylvester considers
$\vc{v}$ and $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ to be invariant. 

Mixing the two systems
leads to the kinds of notational clashes described above. As a particularly absurd example, a physicist
who is asked to suggest a notation for a vector will typically pick up a pen
and write $v^\mu$. We are then led to say that a vector is written in a concrete basis as
a linear combination of dual vectors $\partial_\mu$!

<% begin_sec("Conservation laws") %>\label{sec:killing-conservation}\index{conservation laws!from Killing vectors}
Whenever a spacetime has a Killing vector, geodesics have a constant value of $v^b \xi_b$, where $v^b$ is
the velocity four-vector. For example, because the Schwarzschild metric has a Killing vector $\boldsymbol{\xi} = \partial_t$,
test particles have a conserved value of $v^t$, and therefore we also have conservation of $p^t$, interpreted
as the mass-energy.

\begin{eg}{Energy-momentum in flat 1+1 spacetime}
A flat 1+1-dimensional spacetime has Killing vectors $\partial_x$ and $\partial_t$.
Corresponding to these are the conserved momentum and mass-energy, $p$ and $E$. If we do a Lorentz boost, these
two Killing vectors get mixed together by a linear transformation, corresponding to
a transformation of $p$ and $E$ into a new frame.
\end{eg}

In addition, one can define a globally conserved quantity found by integrating the flux density $P^a=T^{ab}\xi_b$ over the
boundary of any compact orientable region.\footnote{Hawking and Ellis, \emph{The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time}, p.~62,
give a succinct treatment that
describes the flux densities and proves that Gauss's theorem, which ordinarily fails in curved spacetime for a non-scalar flux,
holds in the case where the appropriate Killing vectors exist. For an explicit description
of how one can integrate to find a scalar mass-energy, see Winitzki, \emph{Topics in General Relativity}, section 3.1.5, available for free online.} In case
of a flat spacetime, there are enough Killing vectors to give conservation of energy-momentum and angular momentum.

<% begin_sec("Spherical symmetry") %>\label{sec:spherical-symmetry}\index{spherical symmetry}\index{symmetry!spherical}
A little more work is required if we want to link the existence of Killing vectors to the existence
of a specific symmetry such as spherical symmetry. When we talk about spherical symmetry in the context
of Newtonian gravity or Maxwell's equations, we may say, ``The fields only depend on
$r$,'' implicitly assuming that there is an $r$ coordinate that has a definite meaning for a given choice
of origin. But coordinates in relativity are not guaranteed to have any particular physical
interpretation such as distance from a particular origin. The origin may not even exist as part of the spacetime, as in the Schwarzschild metric,
which has a singularity at the center.
Another possibility is that the origin
may not be unique, as on a Euclidean two-sphere like the earth's surface, where a circle centered
on the north pole is also a circle centered on the south pole; this can also occur
in certain cosmological spacetimes that describe a universe that wraps around on itself spatially.

We therefore define spherical symmetry as follows. A spacetime $S$ is spherically symmetric if we can
write it as a union $S=\cup s_{r,t}$ of nonintersecting subsets $s_{r,t}$,
where each $s$ has the structure of a two-sphere, and the real numbers $r$ and $t$ have
no preassigned physical interpretation, but $s_{r,t}$ is required to vary smoothly as a function of them.
By ``has the structure of a two-sphere,'' we mean that no intrinsic measurement on $s$ will produce any
result different from the result we would have obtained on some two-sphere. A two-sphere has only
two intrinsic properties: (1) it is spacelike, i.e., locally its geometry is approximately that of the Euclidean plane;
(2) it has a constant positive curvature. If we like, we can require that the parameter $r$ be
the corresponding radius of curvature, in which case $t$ is some timelike coordinate.

To link this definition to Killing vectors, we note that condition 2 is equivalent to the following alternative condition:
($2'$) The set $s$ should have three Killing vectors (which by condition 1 are both spacelike), and it should be possible to choose these
Killing vectors such that algebraically they act the same as the ones constructed explicitly in example \ref{eg:sphere-killing} on p.~\pageref{eg:sphere-killing}. As an example
of such an algebraic property, figure \figref{noncommuting-rotations} shows that rotations are noncommutative.

<% begin_sec("Penrose diagrams and causality",nil,'penrose-diagrams') %>\index{Penrose diagram}\index{causal diagram}
We can't directly visualize a four-dimensional manifold. When a spacetime has a symmetry, however, we may
be able to visualize the relevant properties the whole thing by considering a lower-dimensional part of it.
By analogy, if we wanted to visualize the structure of the earth's interior, we might draw a diagram showing
a two-dimensional section through its center. In fact, we could get rid of two dimensions and simply draw
a diagram of a single radial line running from the earth's core to its surface; each point on this line would
then represent a sphere. If we do this in general relativity, for a spacetime that is spherically symmetric,
then we can reduce the four-dimensional to a two-dimensional one, with each point representing a two-sphere.
By applying some further tricks, we will see that we can end up with
a very convenient and useful visualization called a
Penrose diagram, also known as a Penrose-Carter diagram or causal diagram.

<% begin_sec("Flat spacetime",nil,'penrose-minkowski') %>
As a warmup, figure \figref{penrose-minkowski} shows a Penrose diagram for flat (Minkowski) spacetime.
The diagram looks $1+1$-dimensional, but the convention is that spherical
symmetry is assumed, so two more dimensions are hidden, and we're really portraying $3+1$ dimensions. A typical point
on the interior of the diamond region represents a 2-sphere.
On this type of diagram, light cones look just like they would on a
 normal spacetime diagram of Minkowski space, but distance scales are highly distorted.
The diamond represents the entire spacetime, with the distortion fitting
 this entire infinite region into that
 finite area on the page. Despite the distortion, the diagram shows lightlike surfaces as 45-degree diagonals.
Spacelike and timelike geodesics, however, are distorted, as shown by the curves in the diagram.

<% marg(300) %>
<%
  fig(
    'penrose-minkowski',
    %q{Penrose diagram for flat spacetime.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

The distortion becomes greater as we move away from the center of the diagram, and becomes infinite near the
edges. Because of this infinite distortion, the points $i^-$ and $i^+$ actually represent 3-spheres. All timelike
curves start at $i^-$ and end at $i^+$, which are
idealized points at infinity, like the vanishing points in perspective drawings. We can think of $i^+$ as the
``Elephants' graveyard,'' where massive particles go when they die. Similarly, lightlike curves 
end on $\mathscr{I}^+$ (which
includes its mirror image on the left), referred to as \emph{null infinity}.\footnote{See also
p.~\pageref{no-hair-null-infinity}.}\label{null-infinity-intro}
The point at $i^0$ is an infinitely distant endpoint for spacelike curves.
Because of the spherical symmetry, the left and right halves of the diagram are redundant. 

It is possible to make
up explicit formulae that translate back and forth between Minkowski coordinates and points on the diamond, but in
general this is not necessary. In fact, the utility of the diagrams is that they let us think about causal relationships
in coordinate-independent ways. A light cone on the diagram looks exactly like a normal light cone.

Since this particular spacetime is homogeneous, it makes no difference what spatial
location on the diagram we pick as our axis of symmetry.
For example, we could arbitrarily pick the left-hand corner,
the central timelike geodesic (drawn straight)
or one of the other timelike geodesics (represented as if it were curved).

Figure \figref{penrose-schwarzschild} is a Penrose diagram for the Schwarzschild spacetime, i.e., a 
spacetime that looks like Minkowski space, except that it has one eternal black hole in it.
This is a black hole that did not form by gravitational collapse.
This spacetime isn't homogeneous; it has a specific location that is its center of spherical symmetry, and this
is the vertical line on the left marked $r=0$.
The triangle is the spacetime inside the event horizon; we could have copied it across
the $r=0$ line if we had so desired, but the copies would have been redundant.


The Penrose diagram makes it easy to
reason about causal relationships. For example, we can see that if a particle reaches a point inside the event
horizon, its entire causal future lies inside the horizon, and all of its possible future world-lines intersect
the singularity. The horizon is a lightlike surface, which makes sense, because it's defined as
the boundary of the set of points from which a light ray could reach $\mathscr{I}^+$.

<% begin_sec("Astrophysical black hole",nil,'penrose-black-hole') %>
Figure \figref{penrose-black-hole} is a Penrose diagram for a black hole that has formed by gravitational collapse.
Using this type of diagram, we can succinctly address one of the most vexing FAQs about black holes. (Cf.~section
\ref{subsec:black-hole-infalling-matter}, p.~\pageref{subsec:black-hole-infalling-matter},
where we took a more cumbersome approach without Penrose diagrams.)
If a distant observer watches the collapsing cloud of matter from which the black hole forms, her
optical observations will show that the light from the matter becomes more and more gravitationally
redshifted, and if she wishes, she can interpret this as an example of gravitational time dilation.
As she waits longer and longer, the light signals from the infalling matter take longer and longer to arrive.
The redshift approaches infinity as the matter approaches the horizon, so the light waves ultimately become too
low in energy to be detectable by any given instrument. Furthermore, her patience (or her lifetime) will run out,
because the time on her clock approaches infinity as she waits to get signals from matter that is approaching
the horizon. This is all exactly as it should be, since the horizon is by definition the boundary of her observable
universe. (A light ray emitted from the horizon will end up at $i^+$, which is
an end-point of timelike world-lines reached only by observers who have experienced an infinite amount of proper time.)

People who are bothered by these issues often acknowledge the external \emph{unobservability}
of matter passing through the horizon, and then want to pass from this to questions like, 
``Does that mean the black hole never really forms?''
This presupposes that our distant observer has a uniquely defined notion of simultaneity that applies to a
region of space stretching from her own position to the interior of the black hole, so that
she can say what's going on inside the black hole ``now.'' But the notion of simultaneity in general relativity is
even more limited than its counterpart in special relativity.
Not only is simultaneity in general relativity observer-dependent, as in special relativity,
but it is also local rather than global.


In figure \figref{penrose-black-hole-2}, E is an event on the world-line of an observer. The
spacelike surface $\zu{S}_1$ is one possible ``now'' for this observer. According to
this surface, no particle has ever fallen in and reached the
horizon; every such particle has a world-line that intersects $\zu{S}_1$,
and therefore it's still on its way in.

$\zu{S}_2$ is another possible ``now'' for the same
observer at the same time. According to this definition of ``now,''
all the particles have passed the event horizon, but none have hit the singularity yet.
Finally, $\zu{S}_3$ is a ``now'' according to which all the particles have hit the singularity.

If this was special relativity, then we could decide which surface was the
correct notion of simultaneity for the observer, based on the
observer's state of motion. But in general relativity, this only works locally (which
is why I made all three surfaces coincide near E). There is no
well-defined way of deciding which is the correct way
of globally extending this notion of simultaneity.

Although it may seem strange that we can't say whether the
singularity has ``already'' formed according to a distant observer,
this is really just an inevitable result of the fact that the
singularity is spacelike. The same thing happens in the case of a
Schwarzschild spacetime, which we think of as a description of an
eternal black hole, i.e., one that has always existed and always
will. On the similar Penrose diagram for an eternal black hole, we
can still draw a spacelike surface like $\zu{S}_1$ or $\zu{S}_2$, representing a

Ideally we would like to generalize the procedure for drawing Penrose diagrams so that we would be
able to uniquely determine one for any spacetime. This turns out to be not so clear-cut.
The procedure would go something like this:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make an $n$-dimensional section or projection, where usually, but not always, $n=2$.
    \item Do a transformation to reduce the resulting manifold to a flat one of finite size.
    \item Adjoin idealized surfaces and points at infinity.
\end{enumerate}

At step 1, we want to take advantage of any symmetries, such as
rotational symmetry, so that the final result will be informative, be
representative of the whole spacetime, and accurately depict causal
relationships in the original spacetime. If the original spacetime has a low
degree of symmetry (e.g., a spacetime containing three black holes arranged in a triangle),
then this might require $n>2$. At this step we also need to
make sure that lightlike geodesics in the original space correspond
properly to lightlike geodesics in the submanifold. 

For step 2, we have already given a geometrical characterization of the type of transformation we have
in mind, which is called a \emph{conformal transformation}.\index{conformal transformation}
It turns out to be possible to encapsulate this idea in a simple analytic way.
Given a spacetime with a metric $g$, we define a fictitious metric $\tilde{g}=\Omega^2 g$, where
$\Omega$ is a nonzero real number that varies from point to point. 
(Cf.~sec.~\ref{sec:units}, p.~\pageref{sec:units}, where $\Omega$ was constant.)
The idea here is that $g$ and
$\tilde{g}$ agree on where the light cone is, but they disagree on the measurement of distances and
times. The same manifold equipped with
the fictitious metric $\tilde{g}$ is the one being drawn on the page when we make a Penrose diagram.
We let $\Omega\rightarrow0$ as we approach the idealized boundary regions like $i^0$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$,
and this is what causes the Penrose diagram to take up finite space on the page.

It is not possible in general to do what is required in step 2 by making a conformal transformation
to change a manifold into a flat one. A manifold that can be flattened in this way is called conformally
flat. All two-dimensional manifolds are conformally flat, so in the $n=2$ case this is guaranteed.
For $n>3$ we will usually not have conformal flatness if there are gravitational waves or tidal
forces present.\index{conformal flatness}

The most problematic part, surprisingly, is step 3. This topic goes under the general
heading of ``boundary constructions.''\index{boundary constructions}\label{boundary-constructions}
Reviews are available on this topic.\footnote{Ashley, ``Singularity theorems and the abstract boundary construction,''
\url{https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/46055}.
Garcia-Parrado and Senovilla, ``Causal structures and causal boundaries,''
\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0501069}.}
There are a number of more or less specific techniques for constructing a boundary, with an alphabet
soup of names including the g-boundary, c-boundary, b-boundary, and a-boundary.
As someone who is not a specialist in this subfield, the impression I get is that this is an area
of research that has turned out badly and has never produced any useful results, but work continues,
and it is possible that at some point the smoke will clear. As a simple example of what one would like
to get, but doesn't get, from these studies, it would seem natural to ask how many dimensions there are
in a black hole singularity. (See p.~\pageref{singularity-dim-elementary} for a discussion of why this
is a nontrivial question.) Different answers come back from the different methods. For example,
the b-boundary approach says that both black-hole and cosmological singularities are zero-dimensional
points, while in the c-boundary method (which was designed to harmonize with Penrose diagrams) they
are three-surfaces (as one would imagine from the Penrose diagrams).

<% begin_sec("Global hyperbolicity",nil,'global-hyperbolicity') %>\index{global hyperbolicity}
Causality refers to our vaguely defined feeling that the world should have an orderly progression of cause and
effect. Making this notion more precise is surprisingly difficult. Penrose diagrams, and their associated
concepts, are essentially
representations of the causal structure of spacetime, and these turn out to be helpful in putting together one of
the more satisfying attempts to define causality. This definition is called global hyperbolicity.
The obscure terminology is related to the classification of partial differential equations.

Some definitions are required as a preliminary. Consider a set S of events in spacetime.
S is \emph{bounded} if it does not include any of the idealized points on the Penrose diagram that we have added at 
infinity.\footnote{More rigorously,
this is equivalent to saying that for any geodesic in S, there is a bound on the affine parameter.}
S is \emph{closed} if it contains its own boundary.\footnote{To make this more precise,
we proceed as described in section \ref{subsec:tangent-space},
p.~\pageref{subsec:tangent-space} by enlarging the set of points in our spacetime manifold M to include points at
infinitesimal distances from one of the original points. Then S is closed if, for any point in the enlarged
version of S, there is a point lying at an infinitesimal distance from it in the original version of S.}
S is \emph{compact} if it is closed and bounded.

\begin{eg}{Compact and noncompact light cones}\label{eg:compact-and-noncompact}
Figure \figref{compact-and-noncompact} shows a spacetime containing a black hole that forms by gravitational
collapse. Point P is inside the event horizon, Q outside. Consider the following four point-sets:

$I^+(\zu{P})$, called the \emph{chronological future}\index{chronological future} of P, is the interior of P's future-directed light cone.

$J^+(\zu{P})$ is like $I^+(\zu{P})$, but also includes events that are on the boundary of the light cone, i.e., events
that cannot be connected to P by a timelike curve but that can be connected to it by a lightlike curve.
We call this the \emph{causal future}\index{causal future} of P, since it is the set of events that could be caused by P.

$I^+(\zu{Q})$ and $J^+(\zu{Q})$ are the analogous sets built on Q.

Of these four sets, only $J^+(\zu{P})$ is compact. $I^+(\zu{P})$ is noncompact because it is not closed.
$I^+(\zu{Q})$ and $J^+(\zu{Q})$ are noncompact because they are not bounded; they include idealized
points at infinity that lie in $i^+$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$.

In addition to the notation introduced in example \ref{eg:compact-and-noncompact}, we will need
the similar notations $I^-$ and $J^-$ for the corresponding past light-cones.

Definition: A spacetime is globally hyperbolic if: (1) there are no closed, timelike curves (CTCs),\footnote{For
precision, the condition needs to be made a little stronger. We want no closed, non-spacelike curves, and
we also want it to be impossible for curves to exist that are arbitrarily close to being such curves, in the
sense that for any event, there exists a neighborhood around it that can never be revisited.} and
(2) given any two events P and Q, the intersection of $J^+(\zu{P})$ and $J^-(\zu{Q})$ is compact.
(Condition 2 is required only when P and Q are points in the manifold, not boundary points.)

In a globally hyperbolic spacetime, initial-value problems always have unique solutions. That is, we can
pick a spacelike surface and give the value of a wave on that surface, and the wave equation will then
have a unique solution. Such a surface is called a Cauchy surface.\index{Cauchy surface}

We can readily verify by inspection of the Penrose digrams that the spacetimes described earlier in this
section are globally hyperbolic.
Condition 2 implies that the intersection doesn't contain any singularities or points at infinity.
Although black hole spacetimes do contain singularities, the spacelike nature of these singularities implies
that they can never lie in the intersection of light cones as referred to in the definition.
Therefore such spacetimes are globally hyperbolic.

\begin{eg}{Global hyperbolicity}
Figure \subfigref{not-globally-hyperbolic}{1} shows a piece cut out of Minkowski space. The dashed outline
is meant to indicate that the
piece doesn't include its boundary. This spacetime is not globally hyperbolic. For certain choices
of events P and Q, the intersection $J^+(\zu{P})\cap J^-(\zu{Q})$ could extend out to the cut at the
edge. Since the spacetime doesn't include its boundary, this intersection would not be compact.
It's easy to see why causality fails in this spacetime. If we pick a spacelike surface near the bottom
of the diagram, it would only cut through a small part of the bottom of the spacetime. At later times,
the spacetime grows at a rate that is greater than $c$. Therefore such a surface cannot be used as
a Cauchy surface; given the initial conditions on this surface, we cannot predict what will happen in
the parts of the universe that are outside its causal future.

In \subfigref{not-globally-hyperbolic}{2} we have the same example, but now the boundary is included.
This set is not a manifold, which excludes it from consideration as a spacetime in general relativity.

Figure \subfigref{not-globally-hyperbolic}{3} is a picture of Minkowski space with a timelike singularity
in it (dashed line). Singularities are not point-sets in the manifold, so topologically,
this is like Minkowski space with a single timelike curve surgically removed. Global hyperbolicity fails
because the intersection $J^+(\zu{P})\cap J^-(\zu{Q})$ could surround the singularity, and would
not be compact because it would not include its boundary at the singularity.
This violation of global hyperbolicity indicates a failure of causality in such a spacetime
(see p.~\pageref{slime-and-socks}).

By cutting off the lower half of the diamond representing Minkowski spacetime, we obtain
figure \subfigref{not-globally-hyperbolic}{4}. The dashed line indicates that the boundary is not included,
and therefore this is a manifold. It is also globally hyperbolic. This example suggests that global
hyperbolicity does not necessarily capture everything we might ever want to describe in a definition of
causality. If a paleontologist living in this spacetime finds a dinosaur fossil embedded in a rock,
she will naturally infer that a dinosaur lived at some point in the past, causing the fossil to exist.
But perhaps this is not the case --- the hypothetical dinosaur might be one that would have existed before
the boundary. This creationism-flavored violation of causality is of a different flavor than the 
situation we would have had if the bottom edge of the diagram had been a big bang singularity; in that
case, we would have had a knowable \emph{reason} why chains of cause and effect could not be extended back into
the past beyond a certain time.

When we set out to describe a generic spacetime, the Alice in Wonderland quality of the experience is partly
because coordinate invariance allows our time and distance scales to be arbitrarily rescaled, but also
partly because the landscape can change from one moment to the next. The situation is drastically
simplified when the spacetime has a timelike Killing vector. Such a spacetime is said to be stationary.\index{stationary}
Two examples are flat spacetime and the spacetime surrounding the rotating earth (in which
there is a frame-dragging effect). Non-examples include the solar system, cosmological models, gravitational
waves, and a cloud of matter undergoing gravitational collapse.

Can Alice determine, by traveling around her spacetime and carrying out observations, whether it is stationary?
If it's not, then she might be able to prove it. For example, suppose she visits a certain region
and finds that the Kretchmann invariant\index{Kretchmann invariant} $R^{abcd}R_{abcd}$ varies with time in her frame
of reference. Maybe this is because an asteroid is coming her way, in which case she could
readjust her velocity vector to match that of the asteroid. Even if she can't see the asteroid, she can
still try to find a velocity that makes her local geometry stop changing in this particular
way. If the spacetime is truly stationary, then she can always ``tune in'' to the right velocity vector
in this way by searching systematically. If this procedure ever fails, then she has proved that her spacetime
is not stationary.

Self-check: Why is the timelike nature of the Killing vector important in this story?

Proving that a spacetime \emph{is} stationary is harder. This is partly just because spacetime is infinite, so it will
take an infinite amount of time to check everywhere. We aren't inclined to worry too much about this limitation on our geometrical knowledge,
which is of a type that has been familiar since thousands of years ago, when it upset the ancient Greeks
that the parallel postulate could only be checked by following lines out to an infinite distance.
But there is a new type of limitation as well.
The Schwarzschild spacetime is not stationary according to our definition. In the coordinates used in
section \ref{sec:schwarzschild}, $\partial_t$ is a Killing vector, but is only timelike for $r>2m$; for
$r<2m$ it is spacelike. Although the solution describes a black hole that
is going to sit around forever without changing, no observer can ever verify that fact, because once she strays
inside the horizon she must follow a timelike world-line, which will end her program of observation within some
finite time.

This unfortunate feature of our definition of stationarity --- its empirical unverifiability --- is something that
in general we just have to live with. But there is an alternative in the special case of an isolated system,
such as our galaxy or a black hole. It may be a good approximation to ignore distant matter, modeling such a system
with a spacetime that is asymptotically flat.\index{asymptotic flatness}
The notion of asymptotic flatness was introduced informally on p.~\pageref{asymptotic-flatness-idea}.
Formulating the definition of this term rigorously and in a coordinate-invariant way involves a large amount of technical machinery,
since we are not guaranteed to be presented in advance with a special, physically significant set of coordinates that would
lead directly to a quantitative way of defining words like ``nearby.'' 
The essential idea is that a spacetime is asymptotically flat if it is possible to perform a conformal transformation in such a
way that the result has idealized regions at infinity $i^0$, $\mathscr{I}^+$, and $\mathscr{I}^-$ (but not $i^+$ and $i^-$)
that look like those of Minkowski space.
The reader who wants to see the full machinery presented can find presentations in various places, such as
Hawking and Ellis, ch.~11 of Wald, or the online review article ``Conformal Infinity'' at \url{livingreviews.org}.
<% end_sec('asymptotic-flatness') %> % Asymptotic flatness

<% begin_sec("Asymptotically stationary spacetimes") %>
In the case of an asymptotically flat spacetime, we say that it is also asymoptotically stationary\index{stationary!asymptotically}
if it has a Killing vector that becomes timelike far away. Some authors (e.g., Ludvigsen) define ``stationary'' to mean what I'm calling ``asymoptotically stationary,''
others (Hawking and Ellis) define it the same way I do, and still others (Carroll) are not self-consistent.
The Schwarzschild spacetime is asymptotically stationary, but not stationary.

<% begin_sec("A stationary field with no other symmetries") %>
Consider the most general stationary case, in which the only Killing vector is the timelike one.
The only ambiguity in the choice of this vector is a rescaling; its direction is fixed.
At any given point in space, we therefore have a notion of being at rest, which is to have a
velocity vector parallel to the Killing vector. An observer at rest detects no time-dependence in
quantities such as tidal forces.

Points in space thus have a permanent identity. The gravitational field,
which the equivalence principle tells us is normally an elusive, frame-dependent concept, now becomes
more concrete: it is the proper acceleration required in order to stay in one place. We can therefore
use phrases like ``a stationary field,'' without the usual caveats about the coordinate-dependent meaning of ``field.''

Space can be
sprinkled with identical clocks, all at rest. Furthermore, we can compare the rates of these clocks,
and even compensate for mismatched rates, by the following procedure. Since the spacetime is stationary,
experiments are reproducible. If we send a photon or a material particle from a point A in space to
a point B, then identical particles emitted at later times will follow identical trajectories. The
time lag between the arrival of two such particls tells an observer at B the amount of time at B
that corresponds to a certain interval at A. If we wish, we can adjust all the clocks so that their
rates are matched. An example of such rate-matching is the GPS satellite system, in which
the satellites' clocks are tuned to 10.22999999543 MHz, matching the ground-based clocks at 10.23 MHz.
(Strictly speaking, this example is out of place in this subsection, since the earth's field has
an additional azimuthal symmetry.)

It is tempting to conclude that this type of spacetime comes equipped with a naturally preferred time
coordinate that is unique up to a global affine transformation $t\rightarrow at+b$. But to construct such a time
coordinate, we would have to match not just the rates of the clocks, but also their phases.
The best method relativity allows for doing this is 
Einstein synchronization (p.~\pageref{einstein-synch}),\index{Einstein synchronization}\index{synchronization!Einstein convention}
which involves trading a photon back and forth between clocks A and B and adjusting the clocks
so that they agree that each clock gets the photon at the mid-point in time between its arrivals
at the other clock. The trouble is that for a general stationary spacetime, this procedure is not
transitive: synchronization of A with B, and of B with C, does not guarantee agreement between A with C.
This is because the time it takes a photon to travel clockwise around triangle ABCA may be different
from the time it takes for the counterclockwise itinerary ACBA. In other words, we may have a Sagnac effect,\index{Sagnac effect}
which is generally interpreted as a sign of rotation. Such an effect will occur, for example,
in the field of the rotating earth, and it cannot be eliminated by choosing a frame that rotates
along with the earth, because the surrounding space experiences a frame-dragging effect, which
falls off gradually with distance.

Although a stationary spacetime does not have a uniquely preferred time, it does prefer some time
coordinates over others. In a stationary spacetime, it is always possible to find a ``nice'' $t$
such that the metric can be expressed without any $t$-dependence in its components.
<% end_sec %> % A stationary field with no other symmetries

<% begin_sec("A stationary field with additional symmetries") %>
Most of the results given above for a stationary field with no other symmetries also hold in the
special case where additional symmetries are present. The main difference is that we can make
linear combinations of a particular timelike Killing vector with the other Killing vectors, so
the timelike Killing vector is not unique. This means that there is no preferred notion of
being at rest. For example, in a flat spacetime we cannot define an observer to be at rest
if she observes no change in the local observables over time, because that is true for
any inertial observer. Since there is no preferred rest frame, we can't define the gravitational
field in terms of that frame, and there is no longer any preferred definition of the gravitational
field.

In addition to synchronizing all clocks to the same frequency, we
might also like to be able to match all their phases using Einstein
synchronization, which requires transitivity.  Transitivity is
frame-dependent. For example, flat spacetime allows transitivity if we
use the usual coordinates. However, if we change into a rotating frame
of reference, transitivity fails (see p.~\pageref{sec:carousel}).  If
coordinates exist in which a particular spacetime has transitivity,
then that spacetime is said to be static.\index{static spacetime} In
these coordinates, the metric is diagonalized, and since there are no
space-time cross-terms like $\der x\der t$ in the metric, such a
spacetime is invariant under time reversal. Roughly speaking, a static
spacetime is one in which there is no rotation.

<% begin_sec("Birkhoff's theorem",nil,'birkhoff') %>
Birkhoff's theorem,\index{Birkhoff's theorem}\label{birkhoff} proved below, states that in the case of spherical symmetry, 
the vacuum field equations have a solution, the Schwarzschild spacetime, which is unique up to a choice of coordinates
and the value of $m$.
Let's enumerate the assumptions that went into our derivation of the
Schwarzschild metric on p.~\pageref{sec:complete-sch}. These were: (1) the vacuum field equations, (2) spherical symmetry, (3) asymptotic staticity,
(4) a certain choice of coordinates, and (5) $\Lambda=0$.
Birkhoff's theorem says that the assumption of staticity was not necessary.
That is, even if the mass distribution contracts and expands over time, the exterior solution is still the Schwarzschild solution.
Birkhoff's theorem holds because gravitational waves are transverse, not longitudinal (see p.~\pageref{grav-waves-transverse}),
so the mass distribution's radial throbbing cannot generate a gravitational wave.

Proof of Birkhoff's theorem: Spherical symmetry
guarantees that we can introduce coordinates $r$ and $t$ such that the surfaces of constant $r$ and $t$ have the structure of
a sphere with radius $r$. On one such surface we can introduce colatitude and longitude coordinates $\theta$ and $\phi$.
The $(\theta,\phi)$ coordinates can be extended in a natural way to other values of $r$ by choosing the radial lines to lie
in the direction of the covariant derivative vector\footnote{It may seem backwards to start talking about the covariant
derivative of a particular coordinate before a complete coordinate system has even been introduced. But (excluding the trivial case of a flat spacetime),
$r$ is not just an arbitrary coordinate, it is something that an observer at a certain point in spacetime can determine by
mapping out a surface of geometrically identical points, and then determining that surface's radius of curvature.
Another worry is that it is possible for $\nabla_a r$ to misbehave
on certain surfaces, such as the event horizon of the Schwarzschild spacetime, but we can simply require that radial lines
remain continuous as they pass through these surfaces.} $\nabla_a r$, and this ensures that the metric will not have any nonvanishing terms
in $\der r\der\theta$ or $\der r\der\phi$, which could only arise if our choice had broken the symmetry between
positive and negative values of $\der\theta$ and $\der\phi$. Just as we were free to choose any way of threading lines of
constant $(\theta,\phi,t)$ between spheres of different radii, we can also choose how to thread lines of constant $(\theta,\phi,r)$
between different times, and this can be done so as to keep the metric free of any time-space cross-terms such as $\der\theta\der t$.
The metric can therefore be written in the form\footnote{On the same surfaces referred to in the preceding footnote,
the functions $h$ and $k$ may to go to 0 or $\infty$. These turn out to be nothing more serious than coordinate singularities.}
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = h(t,r)\der t^2 - k(t,r)\der r^2 - r^2(\der\theta^2+\sin^2\theta \der\phi^2)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
This has to be a solution of the vacuum field equations, $R_{ab}=0$, and in particular a quick calculation
with Maxima shows that $R_{rt}=-\partial_t k/k^2r$, so $k$ must be independent of time.
With this restriction, we find $R_{rr}=-\partial_rh/hkr-1/r^2-1/kr^2=0$, and since $k$ is time-independent,
$\partial_rh/h$ is also time-independent. This means that for a particular time $t_\zu{o}$, the function $f(r)=h(t_\zu{o},r)$
has some universal shape set by a differential equation, with the only possible ambiguity being an over-all scaling that depends on  $t_\zu{o}$.
But since $h$ is the time-time component of the metric, this scaling corresponds physically to a situation in which every clock, all over the universe,
speeds up and slows down in unison. General relativity is coordinate-independent, so this has no
observable effects, and we can absorb it into a redefinition of $t$ that will cause $h$ to be time-independent. Thus the metric can be expressed
in the time-independent diagonal form
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = h(r)\der t^2 - k(r)\der r^2 - r^2(\der\theta^2+\sin^2\theta \der\phi^2)\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We have already solved the field equations for a metric of this
form and found as a solution the Schwarzschild spacetime.\footnote{The Schwarzschild \emph{spacetime} is the uniquely
defined geometry found by removing the coordinate singularities from this form of the Schwarzschild \emph{metric}.} 
Since the metric's components are all independent of $t$, $\partial_t$ is a Killing vector, and it
is timelike for large $r$, so the Schwarzschild spacetime is asymptotically static.

<% end_sec('birkhoff') %> % Birkhoff's theorem

<% begin_sec("No-hair theorems",nil,'no-hair') %>
 Birkhoff's theorem is similar to a set of theorems called
no-hair theorems describing black holes.\index{no-hair theorems}\index{black hole!no-hair theorem}
The most general no-hair theorem states that a black hole is completely characterized by its mass, charge, and
angular momentum. Other than these three numbers, nobody on the outside can recover any information that was possessed by the matter and
energy that were sucked into the black hole.

It has been proposed\footnote{Johannsen and Psaltis, http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3902v1}
that the no-hair theorem for nonzero angular momentum and zero charge could be tested empirically by
observations of Sagittarius A*.\index{Sagittarius A*} If the observations are consistent with the no-hair theorem, it would
be taken as supporting the validity of general relativity and the interpretation of this object as a supermassive black hole.
If not, then there are various possibilities, including a failure of general relativity to be the correct theory of strong
gravitational fields, or a failure of one of the theorem's other assumptions, such as the nonexistence of closed timelike curves
in the surrounding universe.

The no-hair theorems say that relativity only has a small repertoire of types of black-holes,
defined as regions of space that are causally disconnected from the universe, in the sense that
future light-cones of points in the region do not extend to 
infinity.\footnote{For a more formal statement of
this, see Hawking and Ellis, ``The Large Scale Structure of 
Space-Time,'' p.~315. Essentially, the region must be a connected
region on a spacelike three-surface, and there must be no lightlike world-lines that connect points
in that region
to null infinity. Null infinity\index{null infinity}\label{no-hair-null-infinity}
was introduced briefly on p.~\pageref{null-infinity-intro} 
is defined formally using conformal techniques, but basically
refers to points that are infinitely far away in both space and time, and have the 
two infinities \emph{equal} in a certain
sense, so that a free light ray could end up there. The definition is based on the
assumption that the surrounding spacetime
is asymptotically flat, since otherwise null infinity can't be defined. It is not
actually necessary to assume a singularity
as part of the definition; the no-hair theorems guarantee that one exists.}
%%% -- end of footnote
That is, a black hole is defined as\index{black hole!definition}
a region hidden behind an event horizon, and since the definition of an event horizon is dependent on
the observer, we specify an observer infinitely far away. 
Birkhoff's theorem has a somewhat different structure than those of the no-hair theorems, since
it assumes a symmetry and proves the existence of an event horizon (if the vacuum region is extended
to small enough radii), whereas the no-hair theorems assume an event horizon and prove the form of
the metric, including its symmetries.

The no-hair theorems cannot classify naked singularities,
i.e., those not hidden behind horizons. The role of naked singularities in relativity is the subject
of the cosmic censorship hypothesis, which is an open problem. The theorems do not rule out the
Big Bang singularity, because we cannot define the notion of an observer infinitely far from the Big Bang.
We can also see that Birkhoff's theorem does not prohibit the Big Bang, because
cosmological models are not vacuum solutions with $\Lambda=0$. Black string
solutions are not ruled out by Birkhoff's theorem because they would lack spherical symmetry,
so we need the arguments given on 
p.~\pageref{sec:schwarzschild-d-dimensions} to show that they don't exist.\index{black string}

We saw on pp.~\pageref{singularity-dim-elementary} and \pageref{boundary-constructions} that
there is no clearly defined way to treat a singularity as a geometrical object, and that this
ambiguity extends even to such seemingly straightforward questions as how many dimensions it has.
Geometrically, as Gertrude Stein said about Oakland, there's ``no there there.''\label{no-there-there}
We could also ask whether a black hole singularity has any \emph{physical properties}.
If so, then the no-hair theorems would limit the list of such properties to at most three.
But we cannot ascribe these properties to the singularity itself.
Rather, they are properties of some large region of the spacetime, measurable by an observer at
asymptotic infinity. Such an observer cannot say whether a black hole's mass is a property of
the singularity; she cannot even say whether the singularity exists ``now.'' In this sense
a black hole singularity is not an ``it.'' Asking about ``its'' properties is like asking what
time it is when the tip of the minute hand is at the center
of the clock. The dial only exists around the circumference of the circle, not at its center.

<% begin_sec("The gravitational potential") %>
When Pound and Rebka made the first observation of gravitational redshifts, these shifts were
interpreted as evidence of gravitational time dilation, i.e., a mismatch in the rates of
clocks. We are accustomed to connecting these two ideas by using the expression $e^{-\Delta\Phi}$ for
the ratio of the rates of two clocks (example \ref{eg:gps}, p.~\pageref{eg:gps}), where $\Phi$ is a function of the spatial coordinates,
and this is in fact the most general possible definition of
a gravitational potential $\Phi$ in relativity. Since a stationary field allows us to compare
rates of clocks, it seems that we should be able to define a gravitational potential for any
stationary field. There is a problem, however, because when we talk about a potential, we normally
have in mind something that has encoded within it all there is to know about the field. We would
therefore expect to be able to find the metric from the potential. But the
example of the rotating earth shows that this need not be the case for a general stationary field.
In that example, there are effects like frame-dragging that clearly cannot be deduced from $\Phi$;
for by symmetry, $\Phi$ is independent of azimuthal angle, and therefore it cannot distinguish
between the direction of rotation and the contrary direction. In a static spacetime, these
rotational effects don't exist; a static vacuum spacetime can be described completely in terms
of a single scalar potential plus information about the spatial curvature.

There are two main reasons why relativity does not offer a gravitational
potential with the same general utility as its Newtonian counterpart.\index{potential!relativistic vs. Newtonian}

The Einstein field equations are nonlinear. Therefore one cannot, in general, find the field
created by a given set of sources by adding up the potentials. At best this is a possible
weak-field approximation. In particular, although Birkhoff's theorem\index{Birkhoff's theorem}
is in some ways analogous to the Newtonian shell theorem, it cannot be used to find the metric
of an arbitrary spherically symmetric mass distribution by breaking it up into spherical shells.

It is also not meaningful to talk about any kind of gravitational potential for spacetimes that aren't static or stationary.
For example, consider a cosmological model describing our expanding universe. Such models are
usually constructed according to the Copernican principle that no position in the universe occupies
a privileged place. In other words, they are homogeneous in the sense that they have Killing vectors
describing arbitrary translations and rotations. Because of this high degree of symmetry, a gravitational
potential for such a model would have to be independent of position, and then it clearly could not
encode any information about the spatial part of the metric. Even if we were willing to make the
potential a function of time, $\Phi(t)$, the results would still be nonsense. The gravitational
potential is defined in terms of rate-matching of clocks, so a potential that was purely a function
of time would describe a situation in which all clocks, everywhere in the universe, were changing
their rates in a uniform way. But this is clearly just equivalent to a redefinition of the time
coordinate, which has no observable consequences because general relativity is coordinate-invariant.
A corollary is that in a cosmological spacetime, it is not possible to give a natural prescription for deciding whether a
particular redshift is gravitational (measured by $\Phi$) or kinematic, or some combination of the two\label{potential-cosm}
(see also p.~\pageref{split-kin-grav}).\index{red-shift!cosmological!kinematic versus gravitational}

This section gives a somewhat exotic example.
It is not necessary to read it in order to understand the later material.

In problem \ref{hw:uniform-field} on page \pageref{hw:uniform-field}, we made a wish list of desired properties
for a uniform gravitational field, and found that they could not all be satisfied at once. That is, there is no
global solution to the Einstein field equations that uniquely and satisfactorily embodies all of our Newtonian
ideas about a uniform field. We now revisit this question in the light of our new knowledge.

The 1+1-dimensional metric
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = e^{2gz}\der t^2-\der z^2
\end{equation*}
is the one that uniquely satisfies our expectations based on the equivalence principle (example \ref{eg:gps}, p.~\pageref{eg:gps}), and it is a vacuum solution.
We might logically try to generalize this to 3+1 dimensions as follows:
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = e^{2gz}\der t^2-\der x^2 - \der y^2 - \der z^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
But a funny thing happens now --- simply by slapping on the two new Cartesian axes $x$ and $y$, it turns out
that we have made our vacuum solution into a non-vacuum solution, and not only that, but the
resulting stress-energy tensor is unphysical (ch.~\ref{ch:sources}, problem \ref{hw:uniform-field-sources},
p.~\pageref{hw:uniform-field-sources}).

One way to proceed would be to relax our insistence on making the spacetime one that exactly
embodies the equivalence principle's requirements for a uniform field.\footnote{Thanks to physicsforums.com user
Mentz114 for suggesting this approach and demonstrating the following calculation.%http://physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=377254
} This can be done by
taking $g_{tt}=e^{2\Phi}$, where $\Phi$ is not necessarily equal to $2gz$. By requiring that the metric be a 3+1 vacuum
solution, we arrive at a differential equation whose solution is $\Phi=\ln(z+k_1)+k_2$, which recovers
the flat-space metric that we found in example \ref{eg:const-accel-metric} on page \pageref{eg:const-accel-metric}
by applying a change of coordinates to the Lorentz metric.

What if we want to carry out the generalization from 1+1 to 3+1 without violating the equivalence principle?
For physical motivation in how to get past this obstacle, consider the following argument made by
Born in 1920.\footnote{Max Born, \emph{Einstein's Theory of Relativity}, 1920. In the 1962 Dover edition, the relevant passage
is on p.~320}
Take a frame of reference tied to a rotating disk, as in the example from which Einstein originally took much of the
motivation for creating a geometrical theory of gravity (subsection \ref{sec:carousel}, p.~\pageref{sec:carousel}).\index{rotating frame of reference}
Clocks near the edge of the disk run slowly, and by the equivalence principle, an observer on the disk
interprets this as a gravitational time dilation. But this is not the only relativistic effect seen by
such an observer. Her rulers are also Lorentz contracted as seen by a non-rotating observer, and
she interprets this as evidence of a non-Euclidean spatial geometry. There are some physical differences
between the rotating disk and our default conception of a uniform field, specifically in the question
of whether the metric should be static (i.e., lacking in cross-terms between the space and time variables).
But even so, these considerations make it natural to hypothesize that the correct 3+1-dimensional
metric should have transverse spatial coefficients that decrease with height.

With this motivation, let's consider a metric of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = e^{2z}\der t^2-e^{-2jz}\der x^2 - e^{-2kz}\der y^2 - \der z^2\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $j$ and $k$ are constants, and I've taken $g=1$ for convenience.\footnote{A metric of this general form is referred to as a Kasner
metric. One usually sees it written with a logarithmic change of variables, so that $z$ appears in the base rather than
in the exponent.}\index{Kasner metric} The following Maxima code
calculates the scalar curvature and the Einstein tensor:
\begin{listing}{1}
load(ctensor);
ct_coords:[t,x,y,z];
lg:matrix([exp(2*z),0,0,0],
          [0,-exp(-2*j*z),0,0],
          [0,0,-exp(-2*k*z),0],
          [0,0,0,-1]
);
cmetric();   
scurvature();
leinstein(true);
\end{listing}
% kasner.mac
The output from line 9 shows that the scalar curvature is constant, which is a necessary condition for any spacetime that we want to think of
as representing a uniform field. Inspecting the Einstein tensor output by line 10, we find that
in order to get $G_{xx}$ and $G_{yy}$ to vanish, we need $j$ and $k$ to be $(1 \pm \sqrt{3} i)/2$.
By trial and error, we find that assigning the complex-conjugate values to $j$ and $k$ makes $G_{tt}$ and $G_{zz}$ vanish as well,
so that we have a vacuum solution. This solution is, unfortunately, complex, so it is not of any obvious value as a physically
meaningful result. Since the field equations are nonlinear, we can't use the usual trick of forming real-valued superpositions
of the complex solutions. We could try simply taking the real part of the metric. This gives
$g_{xx}=e^{-z}\cos\sqrt{3}z$ and $g_{yy}=e^{-z}\sin\sqrt{3}z$, and is unsatisfactory because the metric becomes
degenerate (has a zero determinant) at $z=n \pi/2\sqrt{3}$, where $n$ is an integer.

It turns out, however, that there is a very similar solution, found by Petrov in
1962,\footnote{Petrov, in \emph{Recent Developments in General Relativity}, 1962, Pergamon, p. 383. For a presentation that
is freely accessible online, see Gibbons and Gielen,
``The Petrov and Kaigorodov-Ozsv\'{a}th Solutions: Spacetime as a Group Manifold,'' \url{arxiv.org/abs/0802.4082}.} that is real-valued.
The Petrov metric,\index{Petrov metric} which describes a spacetime with cylindrical symmetry, is:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:petrov-metric}
  \der s^2 = -\der r^2 - e^{-2r}\der z^2+e^r[2\sin\sqrt{3}r \der \phi \der t-\cos\sqrt{3}r(\der \phi^2-\der t^2)]
\end{equation*}
Note that it has many features in common with the complex oscillatory solution we found above. There are transverse
length contractions that decay and oscillate in exactly the same way.
The presence of the $ \der \phi \der t$ term tells us that this is a non-static,
rotating solution --- exactly like the one that Einstein and Born had in mind in their prototypical example!
We typically obtain this type of effect due to frame dragging\index{Lense-Thirring effect}\index{frame dragging}
by some rotating massive body (see p.~\pageref{sec:frame-dragging}), and
the Petrov solution can indeed be
interpreted as the spacetime that exists in the vacuum on the exterior of an infinite, rigidly rotating cylinder of ``dust''
(see p.~\pageref{eg:dust-and-radiation-cosm}).

The complicated Petrov metric might seem like the furthest possible thing from a uniform gravitational field,
but in fact it is about the closest thing general relativity provides to such a field.
We first note that the metric has Killing vectors $\partial_z$, $\partial_\phi$, and $\partial_r$,
so it has at least three out of the four translation symmetries we expect from a uniform field.
By analogy with electromagnetism, we would expect this symmetry to be absent in the radial direction, since
by Gauss's law the electric field of a line of charge falls off like $1/r$.
But surprisingly, the Petrov metric is also uniform radially. It is possible to give the fourth
killing vector explicitly (it is $\partial_r + z\partial_z + (1/2)(\sqrt{3}t-\phi)\partial_\phi - (1/2)(\sqrt{3}\phi+t)\partial_t$),
but it is perhaps more transparent to check that it
represents a field of constant strength (problem \ref{hw:petrov-strength}, p.~\pageref{hw:petrov-strength}).

For insight into this surprising result, recall that in
our attempt at constructing the Cartesian version of this metric, we ran into the problem that the metric became
degenerate at $z=n \pi/2\sqrt{3}$. The presence of the $\der \phi \der t$ term prevents this from happening in Petrov's
cylindrical version; two of the metric's diagonal components can vanish at certain values of $r$, but the presence of the off-diagonal component
prevents the determinant from going to zero. (The determinant is in fact equal to $-1$ everywhere.)
What is happening physically is that although the labeling of the $\phi$ and $t$ coordinates suggests a time and an azimuthal
angle, these two coordinates are in fact treated completely symmetrically. At values of $r$ where the cosine factor
equals 1, the metric is diagonal, and has signature $(t,\phi,r,z)=(+,-,-,-)$, but when the cosine equals $-1$,
this becomes $(-,+,-,-)$, so that $\phi$ is now the timelike coordinate. This perfect symmetry between $\phi$ and $t$
is an extreme example of frame-dragging, and is produced because of the specially chosen rate of rotation of the dust
cylinder, such that the velocity of the dust at the outer surface is exactly $c$ (or approaches it).

Classically, we would expect that a test particle released close enough to the cylinder would be pulled in
by the gravitational attraction and destroyed on impact, while a particle released farther away would fly
off due to the centrifugal force, escaping and eventually approaching a constant velocity. Neither of these would be anything like the experience of
a test particle released in a uniform field. But consider a particle released at rest in the rotating frame
at a radius $r_1$ for which $\cos\sqrt{3}r_1=1$, so that $t$ is the timelike coordinate. The particle accelerates (let's say outward),
but at some point it arrives at an $r_2$ where the cosine equals zero, and the $\phi-t$ part of the metric is purely
of the form $\der\phi\der t$. At this location, we can define local coordinates $u=\phi-t$ and $v=\phi+t$,
so that the metric depends only on $\der u^2-\der v^2$. One of the coordinates, say $u$, is now the timelike one.
Since our particle is material,
its world-line must be timelike, so it is swept along in the $-\phi$ direction.
Gibbons and Gielen show that the particle will now come back inward, and continue forever by oscillating
back and forth between two radii at which the cosine vanishes.

<% begin_sec("Closed timelike curves") %>\label{sec:ctc}\index{closed timelike curves}
This oscillation still doesn't sound like the motion of a particle in a uniform field, but another strange thing happens,
as we can see by taking another look at the values of $r$ at which the cosine vanishes.
At such a value of $r$, construct a curve of the form $(t=\text{constant},r=\text{constant},\phi,z=\text{constant})$.
This is a closed curve, and its proper length is zero, i.e., it is lightlike. This violates causality.
A photon could travel around this path and arrive at its starting point at the same time when it was emitted.
Something similarly weird hapens to the test particle described above: whereas it seems to fall sometimes up and sometimes down, in fact it
is always falling down --- but sometimes it achieves this by falling up while moving backward in time!

Although the Petov metric violates causality,
Gibbons and Gielen have shown that it satisfies the chronology protection conjecture:\index{chronology protection conjecture}
``In the context of causality violation we have shown that one cannot create CTCs [closed timelike curves] by spinning up a cylinder beyond
its critical angular velocity by shooting in particles on timelike or null curves.''

We have an exact vacuum solution to the Einstein field equations that violates causality. This raises troublesome questions
about the logical self-consistency of general relativity. 
A very readable and entertaining overview of these issues is given in the final chapter of Kip Thorne's \emph{Black Holes and Time Warps:
Einstein's Outrageous Legacy}. In a toy model constructed by Thorne's students, involving a billiard ball and a wormhole, it turned out that there always
seemed to be self-consistent solutions to the ball's equations of motion, but they were not unique, and they often involved
disquieting possibilities in which the ball went back in time and collided with its earlier self. Among other things, this seems to lead to
a violation of conservation of mass-energy, since no mass was put into the system to create extra copies of the ball. This would then
be an example of the fact that, as discussed in section \ref{sec:no-conservation-laws}, general
relativity does not admit global conservation laws. However, there is also an argument that the mouths of the wormhole
change in mass in such a way as to preserve conservation of energy.\footnote{\url{http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/string/archives/000550.html}}
