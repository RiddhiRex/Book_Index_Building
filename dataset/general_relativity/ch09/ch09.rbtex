<% begin_sec("The speed of gravity") %>\label{sec:speed-of-gravity}

In Newtonian gravity, gravitational effects are assumed to propagate at infinite speed, so that for example the
lunar tides correspond at any time to the position of the moon at the same instant. This clearly can't be
true in relativity, since simultaneity isn't something that different observers even agree on.
Not only should the ``speed of gravity'' be finite, but 
it seems implausible that it would be greater than $c$; in section \ref{sec:lorentz-geometry} (p. \pageref{sec:lorentz-geometry}),
we argued based on empirically well established principles that there must be a maximum speed of cause and
effect. Although the argument was only applicable to special relativity, i.e., to a flat spacetime,
it seems likely to apply to general
relativity as well, at least for low-amplitude waves on a flat background.
As early as 1913, before Einstein had even developed the full theory of general relativity, he
had carried out calculations in the weak-field limit showing that gravitational effects should propagate
at $c$.\index{gravitational waves!propagation at $c$}
We will work out an argument to this effect (using a different technique
than Einstein's) in section \ref{subsec:gw-expected-properties}.
This seems eminently reasonable, since (a) it is likely to be consistent with causality, and (b) $G$ and $c$ are the
only constants with units that appear in the field equations (obscured by our choice of units, in which $G=1$ and $c=1$),
and the only velocity-scale that can be constructed from
these two constants is $c$ itself.\footnote{High-amplitude waves need \emph{not} propagate at $c$. For example, general relativity predicts
that a gravitational-wave pulse propagating on a background of curved spacetime develops a trailing edge that propagates at less
than $c$ (Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler, p. 957).
This effect is weak when the amplitude is small or the wavelength is short compared to the scale of the background 
curvature.\index{gravitational waves!propagation at less than $c$, for high amplitudes}}

As shown by the following timeline, Einstein's prediction was surprisingly difficult to verify.

\end{tabular}

Why did this process take over a century? Naive arguments suggest that it should have been much easier.
Workers as early as Newton and Laplace had investigated the consequences of a gravitational force that
propagated at some finite speed. It is easy to show that, if nonrelativistic ideas about spacetime are retained,
the predicted results are dramatic and not consistent with observation. For example, the earth and moon orbit
about their common center of mass, which is inside the earth but offset from the earth's center.
Suppose that we retain Newton's ideas about spacetime, but modify Newton's law of gravity to incorporate
a time delay, with changes in the gravitational field propagating at some speed $u$. The force acting on the
moon would then point toward the earth's location at a slightly earlier time, and this force would therefore
have a component parallel to the moon's direction of motion. The force would do positive work on the moon and
also exert a positive torque, the result being that the moon would spiral away. This is not consistent with the
fact that the earth-moon system has remained fairly stable for billions of years, unless we take $u$ to be
very large. From the stability of orbits in the solar system, Laplace estimated $u\gtrsim 10^{15}\ \munit/\sunit$,
many orders of magnitude greater than $c$. This seemed to support the Newtonian picture, in which gravity acts
instantaneously at a distance. A time delay in Newtonian spacetime would also have been easily detected by
twentieth-century measurements using space probes and radio astronomy.\footnote{For an example of an erroneous
2003 claim to have performed such a test, see Fomalont and Kopeikin, \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302294}.
Their claims were debunked by  Samuel, \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0304006},
and Will, \url{http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301145}.}

The trouble with such arguments is that when we substitute relativistic spacetime for Newtonian spacetime,
it is no longer expected that a time-delayed field will point toward the retarded position of the source.
For example, if an electric charge moves inertially, and is observed in a frame in which it is moving, then
Lorentz invariance requires that its electric field lines be straight, and converge on the charge's \emph{present}
position in that frame.\footnote{Crowell, Special Relativity, section 10.4} The speed of gravity therefore
turns out to be much harder to measure than Laplace had believed.

The first strong empirical evidence of gravitational waves came in 1982. The Hulse-Taylor system
(page \pageref{hulse-taylor-pulsar})
contains two neutron stars orbiting around their common center of mass, and the period of the orbit is observed to be decreasing
gradually over time (figure \figref{pulsar-period-decreasing}). This is interpreted as evidence that the stars are losing energy to radiation of 
gravitational waves.\footnote{Stairs, ``Testing General Relativity with Pulsar Timing,'' \url{http://relativity.livingreviews.org/Articles/lrr-2003-5/}}
As we'll see in section \ref{sec:rate-of-gravitational-radiation}, the rate of energy loss is in excellent agreement with the predictions
of general relativity.

An even more dramatic, if less clearcut, piece of evidence is
Komossa, Zhou, and Lu's observation\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4585}} of a supermassive black hole
that appears to be recoiling from its parent galaxy at a velocity of 2650 km/s (projected along the line of
sight). They interpret this as evidence for the following scenario. In the early universe, galaxies form with
supermassive black holes at their centers. When two such galaxies collide, the black holes can merge. The
merger is a violent process in which intense gravitational waves are emitted, and these waves carry a large
amount of momentum, causing the black holes to recoil at a velocity greater than the escape velocity of the
merged galaxy.

Although the energy loss from systems such as the Hulse-Taylor binary provide strong evidence that gravitational waves
exist and carry energy, physicists and astronomers still wanted to detect them directly, and serious attempts to
design and build such systems began around 1962. The design that finally achieved success used interferometers
which detect oscillations in the lengths of their own arms.
The first gravitational-wave event was detected, by this method, in 2016,
by the Advanced LIGO collaboration.\footnote{\url{https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P150914/public}}
The event is believed to have been the result of the collision of two black holes.

In 2017, an event interpreted as
the collision of two neutron stars was detected by both gravitational and electromagnetic
radiation, verifying to high precision that gravitational waves propagate at $c$.

Although the earlier 2016 collision of black holes did not directly compare the propagation of light and
gravity, it provided a different kind of check on the propagation of gravitational waves at $c$.
The
waveform detected in this event was a ``chirp'' that glided up in frequency as the black holes spiraled
toward one another and sped up. Since the wave was in transit
for over a billion years, and the waveform lasted a fraction of a second, it follows that gravitational waves
within this frequency range all travel at very nearly the same velocity, i.e., there is a very tight upper
limit on the dispersion of gravitational waves.

A complementary space-based system, LISA, has been proposed for launch in 2020, but its funding is uncertain.
The two devices would operate in complementary frequency ranges (figure \figref{ligo-and-lisa-sensitivities}).
A selling point of LISA is that if it is launched, there are a number of sources in the sky, with known properties, that
are known to be easily within its range of sensitivity.\footnote{G. Nelemans, ``The Galactic Gravitational wave foreground,''
\url{arxiv.org/abs/0901.1778v1}} One excellent candidate is
HM Cancri, a pair of white dwarfs with an orbital period of 5.4 minutes, shorter than that of any 
other known binary star.\footnote{Roelofs et al., ``Spectroscopic Evidence for a 5.4-Minute Orbital Period in HM Cancri,''

Even without performing the calculations for a system like the Hulse-Taylor binary, it is easy to show that if such waves exist, they must be
capable of carrying away energy. Consider two equal masses in highly elliptical orbits about their common center of mass, figure \figref{atlas}.\label{atlas-argument}
The motion is nearly one-dimensional.
As the masses recede from one another, they feel a delayed version of the gravitational force originating from a time when they were closer together
and the force was stronger. The result is that in the near-Newtonian limit, they lose more kinetic and gravitational energy than they
would have lost in the purely Newtonian theory. Now they come back inward in their orbits. As they approach one another, the time-delayed
force is anomalously weak, so they gain less mechanical energy than expected. The result is that with each cycle, mechanical energy
is lost. We expect that this energy is carried by the waves, in the same way that radio waves carry the energy lost by a transmitting antenna.\footnote{One has
to be careful with this type of argument. In particular, one can obtain incorrect correct results by attempting to generalize this one-dimensional
argument to motion in more than one dimension, because the effective semi-Newtonian interaction is not just a time-delayed version of Newton's
law; it also includes velocity-dependent forces. It is easy to see why such velocity-dependence must occur in the simpler case of electromagnetism.
Suppose that charges A and B are not at rest relative to one another. In B's frame, the electric field from A must come from the direction of the position
that an observer comoving with B would extrapolate linearly from A's last known position and velocity, as determined by light-speed calculation.
This follows from Lorentz invariance, since
this is the direction that will be seen by an observer comoving with A. A full discussion is given by Carlip, \url{arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9909087v2}.}

Not only can these waves remove mechanical energy from a system, they can also deposit energy in a detector,
as shown by the nonmathematical ``sticky bead
argument'' (figure \figref{sticky-bead}), which was originated by Feynman in 1957 and later popularized by Bondi.

Now strictly speaking, we have only shown that gravitational waves can extract or donate mechanical
energy, but not that the waves themselves \emph{transmit} this energy. The distinction isn't one that
normally occurs to us, since we are trained to believe that energy is always conserved. But we know that,
for fundamental reasons, general relativity doesn't have global conservation laws that apply to all spacetimes
(p.~\pageref{sec:no-conservation-laws}).
Perhaps the energy lost by the Hulse-Taylor system is simply gone, never to reappear, and the energy
imparted to the sticky bead is simply generated out of nowhere. On the other hand, general relativity
does have global conservation laws for certain specific classes of spacetimes, including, for example,
a conserved scalar mass-energy in the case of a stationary spacetime (p.~\pageref{sec:killing-conservation}).
Spacetimes containing gravitational waves are not stationary, but perhaps there is something similar we can do
in some appropriate special case.

Suppose we want an expression for the energy of a gravitational wave in terms of its amplitude.
This seems like it ought to be straightforward. We have such expressions in other classical field theories.
In electromagnetism, we have energy densities $+(1/8\pi k) |\vc{E}|^2$ and $+(1/2\mu_\zu{o})  |\vc{B}|^2$
associated with the electric and magnetic fields.
In Newtonian gravity, we can assign an energy density
$-(1/8\pi G)|\vc{g}|^2$ to the gravitational field $\vc{g}$; the minus sign indicates that when masses
glom onto each other, they produce a greater field, and energy is released.

In general relativity, however, the equivalence principle tells us that for any gravitational field measured
by one observer, we can find another observer, one who is free-falling, who says that the local field is zero.
It follows that we cannot associate an energy with the curvature of a particular region of spacetime in
any exact way. The best we can do is to find expressions that give the energy density (1) in the limit of
weak fields, and (2) when averaged over a region of space that is large compared to the wavelength.
These expressions are not unique. There are a number of ways to write them in terms of the metric and
its derivatives, and they all give the same result in the appropriate limit. The reader who is interested
in seeing the subject developed in detail is referred to Carroll's \emph{Lecture Notes on General Relativity},
\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/?9712019}. Although this sort of thing is technically messy,
we can accomplish quite a bit simply by knowing that such results do exist, and that although they
are non-unique in general, they are uniquely well defined in certain cases. Specifically, when one wants
to discuss gravitational waves, it is usually possible to assume an asymptotically flat spacetime. In an
asymptotically flat spacetime, there is a scalar mass-energy, called the ADM mass,\index{ADM mass}\index{mass!ADM}\index{mass-energy!ADM}
that is conserved. In this restricted sense, we are assured that the books balance, and that the emission and absorption of gravitational
waves really does mean the \emph{transmission} of a fixed amount of energy.

<% begin_sec("Expected properties",nil,'gw-expected-properties') %>
To see what properties we should expect for gravitational radiation, first consider the reasoning that led to the construction of
the Ricci and Einstein tensors. If a certain volume of space is filled with test particles, then the Ricci and Einstein
tensors measure the tendency for this volume to ``accelerate;'' i.e., $-\der^2 V/\der t^2$ is a measure of the attraction of
any mass lying inside the volume. A distant mass, however, will exert only tidal forces, which distort a region without
changing its volume. This suggests that as a gravitational wave passes through a certain region of space, it should distort the shape
of a given region, without changing its volume.

When the idea of gravitational waves was first discussed, there was some skepticism about whether they represented
an effect that was observable, even in principle. The most naive such doubt is of the same flavor as the one
discussed in section \ref{sec:observability-of-expansion} about the observability of the universe's expansion: if
everything distorts, then don't our meter-sticks distort as well, making it impossible to measure the effect?
The answer is the same as before in section \ref{sec:observability-of-expansion}; systems that are gravitationally
or electromagnetically bound do not have their scales distorted by an amount equal to the change in the elements
of the metric.

A less naive reason to be skeptical about gravitational waves is that just because a metric looks oscillatory, that
doesn't mean its oscillatory behavior is observable. Consider the following example.
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - \left(1+\frac{1}{10}\sin x\right)\der x^2 - \der y^2 - \der z^2
\end{equation*}
The Christoffel symbols depend on derivatives of the form $\partial_a g_{bc}$, so here the only nonvanishing
Christoffel symbol is $\Gamma\indices{^x_{xx}}$. It is then straightforward to check that 
the Riemann tensor $  R\indices{^a_{bcd}} = \partial_c \Gamma\indices{^a_{db}} - \partial_d \Gamma\indices{^a_{cb}} 
                        + \Gamma\indices{^a_{ce}}\Gamma\indices{^e_{db}}-\Gamma\indices{^a_{de}}\Gamma\indices{^e_{cb}}$
vanishes by symmetry. Therefore this metric must really just be a flat-spacetime metric that has been subjected
to a silly change of coordinates.

Self-check: $R$ vanishes, but $\Gamma$ doesn't. Is there a
reason for paying more attention to one or the other?

To keep the curvature from vanishing, it looks like we need a metric in which the oscillation is not
restricted to a single variable. For example, the metric
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - \left(1+\frac{1}{10}\sin y\right)\der x^2 - \der y^2 - \der z^2
\end{equation*}
does have nonvanishing curvature.\index{polarization!of gravitational waves}\index{transverse polarization!of gravitational waves}\index{gravitational waves!transverse nature}\label{grav-waves-transverse}
In other words, it seems like we should be looking for transverse waves
rather than longitudinal ones.\footnote{A more careful treatment shows that longitudinal waves can always be
interpreted as physically unobservable coordinate waves, in the limit of large distances from the source. On the other hand,
it is clear that no such prohibition against longitudinal waves could apply universally, because such a constraint can only
be Lorentz-invariant if the wave propagates at $c$ (see p.~\pageref{eg:polzn-constraints}), whereas high-amplitude waves need not propagate at $c$.
Longitudinal
waves near the source are referred to as Type III solutions in a classification scheme due to Petrov.\index{Petrov classification}\index{Type III solution}\index{Type N solution}
Transverse waves, which are what we could actually observe in practical experiments, are type N.} On the other hand, this metric cannot be a solution to the vacuum field equations,
since it doesn't preserve volume. It also stands still, whereas we expect that solutions to the field
equations should propagate at the velocity of light, at least for small amplitudes. These conclusions are
self-consistent, because a wave's polarization can only be constrained if it propagates at $c$ (see p.~\pageref{eg:polzn-constraints}).

Based on what we've found out, the following seems like a metric that might have a fighting chance of
representing a real gravitational wave:
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - \left(1+A\sin (z-t)\right)\der x^2 - \frac{\der y^2}{1+A\sin (z-t)} - \der z^2
\end{equation*}
It is transverse, it propagates at $c(=1)$, and the fact that $g_{xx}$ is the reciprocal of $g_{yy}$ makes
it volume-conserving. The following Maxima program calculates its Einstein tensor:
\begin{listing}{1}
load(ctensor);
ct_coords:[t,x,y,z];
lg:matrix([1,0,0,0],
          [0,-(1+A*sin(z-t)),0,0],
          [0,0,-1/(1+A*sin(z-t)),0],
          [0,0,0,-1]);
cmetric();
einstein(true);
\end{listing}
For a representative component of the Einstein tensor, we find
\begin{equation*}
  G_{tt} = -\frac{A^2\cos^2(z-t)}{2+4A\sin(z-t)+2A^2\sin^2(z-t)}
\end{equation*}
For small values of $A$, we have $|G_{tt}| \lesssim A^2/2$. The vacuum field equations require $G_{tt}=0$, so
this isn't an exact solution. But all the components of $G$, not just $G_{tt}$, are of order $A^2$, so
this \emph{is} an \emph{approximate} solution to the equations.

It is also straightforward to check that propagation at approximately $c$ was a necessary feature.
For example, if we replace the factors of $\sin(z-t)$ in the metric with $\sin(z-2t)$, we get
a $G_{xx}$ that is of order unity, not of order $A^2$.

To prove that gravitational waves are an observable effect, we would like to be able to display
a metric that (1) is an exact solution of the vacuum field equations; (2) is not merely a coordinate wave;
and (3) carries momentum and energy.
As late as 1936, Einstein and Rosen published a paper claiming that gravitational waves were
a mathematical artifact, and did not actually exist.\footnote{Some of the history is related at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_bead_argument}.}

<% end_sec %> % Expected properties

<% begin_sec("Some exact solutions") %>

In this section we study several examples of exact solutions to the field equations.
Each of these can readily be shown not to be a mere coordinate wave, since
in each case the Riemann tensor has nonzero elements.

\begin{eg}{An exact solution}
We've already seen, e.g., in the derivation of the Schwarzschild metric in section \ref{sec:complete-sch},
that once we have an approximate solution to the equations of general relativity, we may be able to
find a series solution. Historically this approach was only used as a last resort, because the lack of
computers made the calculations too complex to handle, and the tendency was to look for tricks that
would make a closed-form solution possible. But today the series method has the advantage that any mere
mortal can have some reasonable hope of success with it --- and there is nothing more boring (or demoralizing)
than laboriously learning someone else's special trick that only works for a specific problem.
In this example, we'll see that such an approach comes tantalizingly close to providing an exact,
oscillatory plane wave solution to the field equations.

Our best solution so far was of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - \left(1+f\right)\der x^2 - \frac{\der y^2}{1+f} - \der z^2\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $f=A\sin (z-t)$. This doesn't seem likely to be an exact solution for large amplitudes, since
the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are treated asymmetrically. In the extreme case of $|A| \ge 1$, there
would be singularities in $g_{yy}$, but not in $g_{xx}$. Clearly the metric will have to have some
kind of nonlinear dependence on $f$, but we just haven't found quite the right nonlinear dependence.
Suppose we try something of this form:
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - \left(1+f+cf^2\right)\der x^2 - \left(1-f+df^2\right)\der y^2 - \der z^2
\end{equation*}
This approximately conserves volume, since $(1+f+\ldots)(1-f+\ldots)$ equals unity, up to terms of
order $f^2$. The following program tests this form.
\begin{listing}{1}
load(ctensor);
ct_coords:[t,x,y,z];
f : A*exp(%i*k*(z-t)); 
lg:matrix([1,0,0,0],
          [0,-(1+f+c*f^2),0,0],      
          [0,0,-(1-f+d*f^2),0],     
          [0,0,0,-1]);
cmetric();
einstein(true);
\end{listing}
% wave_series.mac
In line 3, the motivation for using the complex exponential rather than a sine wave in $f$ is the usual
one of obtaining simpler expressions; as we'll see, this ends up causing problems. In lines 5 and 6, the symbols $c$ and $d$ have not
been defined, and have not been declared as depending on other variables, so Maxima treats them
as unknown constants. The result is $G_{tt} \sim (4 d + 4 c - 3)A^2$ for small $A$, so we can make
the $A^2$ term disappear by an appropriate choice of $d$ and $c$. For symmetry, we choose $c=d=3/8$.
With these values of the constants, the result for $G_{tt}$ is of order $A^4$.
This technique can be extended to higher and higher orders of approximation, resulting in an exact series
solution to the field equations.

Unfortunately, the whole story ends up being too good to be true. The resulting metric has complex-valued
elements. If general relativity were a linear field theory, then we could apply the usual technique of
forming linear combinations of expressions of the form $e^{+i\ldots}$ and $e^{-i\ldots}$, so as to give
a real result. But the field equations of general relativity are nonlinear, so the resulting
linear combination is no longer a solution. The best we can do is to make a non-oscillatory real exponential
solution (problem \ref{hw:real-exponential}).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{An exact, oscillatory, non-monochromatic solution}\label{eg:rindler-pq}
Assume a metric of the form
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - p(z-t)^2\der x^2 - q(z-t)^2\der y^2 - \der z^2\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $p$ and $q$ are arbitrary functions. Such a metric would clearly represent
some kind of transverse-polarized plane wave traveling at velocity $c(=1)$ in the $z$ direction.
The following Maxima code calculates its Einstein tensor.
\begin{listing}{1}
load(ctensor);
ct_coords:[t,x,y,z];
depends(p,[z,t]);
depends(q,[z,t]);
lg:matrix([1,0,0,0],

          [0,0,0,-1]);
cmetric();
einstein(true);
\end{listing}
The result is proportional to $\ddot{q}/q+\ddot{p}/p$, so any functions $p$ and $q$
that satisfy the differential equation $\ddot{q}/q+\ddot{p}/p=0$ will result in
a solution to the field equations.
Setting $p(u)=1+A\cos u$, for example, we find that $q$ is oscillatory, but with a period longer than
$2\pi$ (problem \ref{hw:rindler-pq}).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{An exact, plane, monochromatic wave}\label{eg:exact-plane}

  \der s^2 = (1-h)\der t^2 - \der x^2 - \der y^2 - (1+h)\der z^2 +2h\der z\der t\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $h=f(z-t)xy$, and $f$ is any function, is an exact solution of the field equations (problem \ref{hw:exact-plane}).

Because $h$ is proportional to $xy$, this does not appear at first glance to be a uniform plane wave.
One can verify, however, that all the components of the Riemann tensor depend only on $z-t$, not on
$x$ or $y$. Therefore there is no measurable property of this metric that varies with $x$ and $y$.

<% begin_sec("Rate of radiation") %>\label{sec:rate-of-gravitational-radiation}\index{gravitational waves!rate of radiation}
How can we find the rate of gravitational radiation from a system such as the Hulse-Taylor pulsar?

Let's proceed by analogy. The simplest source of sound waves is something like the cone of a stereo speaker.
Since typical sound waves have wavelengths measured in meters, the entire speaker is generally small compared to the wavelength.
The speaker cone is a surface of oscillating displacement $x=x_\zu{o}\sin\omega t$. 
Idealizing such a source to a radially pulsating spherical surface, we have an oscillating monopole that radiates sound waves
uniformly in all directions. To find the power radiated, we note that the velocity of the source-surface is
proportional to $x_\zu{o}\omega$, so the kinetic energy of the air immediately in contact with it is proportional
to $\omega^2 x_\zu{o}^2$. The power radiated is therefore proportional to $\omega^2 x_\zu{o}^2$.

In electromagnetism, conservation of charge forbids the existence of an oscillating electric monopole.
The simplest radiating source is therefore an oscillating electric dipole $D=D_\zu{o}\sin\omega t$. If the dipole's physical size
is small compared to a wavelength of the radiation, then the radiation is an inefficient process; at any
point in space, there is only a small difference in path length between the positive and negative portions of the dipole,
so there tends to be strong cancellation of their contributions, which were emitted with opposite phases.
The result is that the wave's electromagnetic potential four-vector (section \ref{subsec:em-four-vector}) is proportional
to $D_\zu{o}\omega$, the fields to $D_\zu{o}\omega^2$, and the radiated power to $D_\zu{o}^2\omega^4$. The factor of
$\omega^4$ can be broken down into $(\omega^2)(\omega^2)$, where the first factor of $\omega^2$ occurs for
reasons similar to the ones that explain the $\omega^2$ factor for the monopole radiation of sound, while the
second $\omega^2$ arises because the smaller $\omega$
is, the longer the wavelength, and the greater the inefficiency in radiation caused by the small size of the source
compared to the wavelength.

\begin{eg}{AM radio}
Commercial AM radio uses wavelengths of several hundred meters, so AM dipole antennas are usually orders of magnitude
shorter than a wavelength. This causes severe attentuation in both transmission and reception. (There
are theorems called reciprocity theorems that relate efficiency of transmission to efficiency of
reception.) Receivers therefore need to use of a large amount of amplification.
This doesn't cause problems, because the ambient sources of RF noise are attenuated by the short
antenna just as severely as the signal.
\end{eg}

Since our universe doesn't seem to have particles with negative mass, we can't form a gravitational dipole by
putting positive and negative masses on opposite ends of a stick --- and furthermore, such a stick will not spin freely
about its center, because its center of mass does not lie at its center! In a more realistic system, such as the
Hulse-Taylor pulsar, we have two unequal masses orbiting about their common center of mass. By conservation of
momentum, the mass dipole moment of such a system is constant, so we cannot have an oscillating mass dipole.
The simplest source of gravitational radiation is therefore an oscillating mass quadrupole, $Q=Q_\zu{o}\sin\omega t$.
As in the case of the oscillating electric dipole, the radiation is suppressed if, as is usually the case,
the source is small compared to the wavelength. The suppression is even stronger in the case of a quadrupole,
and the result is that the radiated power is proportional to $Q_\zu{o}^2\omega^6$.

This result has the interesting property of being invariant under a rescaling of coordinates. In geometrized units,
mass, distance, and time all have the same units, so that $Q_\zu{o}^2$ has units of $(\text{length}^3)^2$
while $\omega^6$ has units of $(\text{length})^{-6}$. This is exactly what is required, because in geometrized
units, power is unitless, $\text{energy}/\text{time}=\text{length}/\text{length}=1$.

We can also tie the $\omega^6$ dependence to our earlier argument, on p.~\pageref{atlas-argument}, for the
dissipation of energy by gravitational waves. The argument was that gravitating bodies are subject to time-delayed
gravitational forces, with the result that orbits tend to decay. This argument only works if the forces are time-varying;
if the forces are constant over time, then the time delay has no effect. For example, in the semi-Newtonian limit the field
of a sheet of mass is independent of distance from the sheet. (The electrical analog of this fact is easily proved using
Gauss's law.) If two parallel sheets fall toward one another, then neither is subject to a time-varying force, so there
will be no radiation. In general, we expect that there will be no gravitational radiation from a particle unless
the third derivative of its position $\der^3 x/\der t^3$ is nonzero. (The same is true for electric quadrupole radiation.)
In the special case where the position oscillates sinusoidally, the chain rule tells us that taking the third derivative
is equivalent to bringing out a factor of $\omega^3$. Since the amplitude of gravitational waves is proportional to
$\der^3 x/\der t^3$, their energy varies as $(\der^3 x/\der t^3)^2$, or $\omega^6$.

The general pattern we have observed is that for multipole radiation of order $m$ (0=monopole, 1=dipole, 2=quadrupole),
the radiated power depends on $\omega^{2(m+1)}$. Since gravitational radiation must always have $m=2$ or higher, we
have the very steep $\omega^6$ dependence of power on frequency.
This demonstrates that if
we want to see strong gravitational radiation, we need to look at systems that are oscillating extremely rapidly.
For a binary system with unequal masses of order $m$, with orbits having radii of order $r$, we have $Q_\zu{o}\sim mr^2$.
Newton's laws give $\omega\sim m^{1/2} r^{-3/2}$, which is essentially Kepler's law of periods. The result is
that the radiated power should depend on $(m/r)^5$. 
Reinserting the proper constants to give an equation that allows practical calculation
in SI units, we have
\begin{equation*}
  P = k \frac{G^4}{c^5} \left(\frac{m}{r}\right)^5\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $k$ is a unitless constant of order unity.

For the Hulse-Taylor pulsar,\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407149}}\index{Hulse-Taylor pulsar}
we have $m \sim 3\times 10^{30}\ \kgunit$ (about one and a half solar masses)
and $r \sim 10^9\ \munit$. The binary pulsar is made to order our purposes, since $m/r$ is
extremely large compared to what one sees in almost any other astronomical system. The resulting estimate for the
power is about $10^{24}$ watts.

% G=6.6 10^-11 m3kg-1s-2; c=3 10^8 m/s ;  m=3* 10^30 kg ;  r=10^9 m ; G^4*c^-5(m/r)^5
%   7.80853333333375*10^21 W

The pulsar's period is observed to be steadily lengthening at a rate of $\alpha=2.418\times 10^{-12}$ seconds per second.
To compare this with our crude theoretical estimate, we take the Newtonian energy of the system $Gm^2/r$ and multiply by
$\omega\alpha$, giving $10^{25}$ W, which checks to within an order of magnitude.
A full general-relativistic calculation reproduces the observed value of $\alpha$ to within the 0.1\% error bars
of the data.

(a) Starting on page \pageref{subsec:geometrical-gravity}, we have associated geodesics with the world-lines of low-mass
objects (test particles). Use the Hulse-Taylor pulsar as an example to show that the assumption of low mass was a necessary one.
How is this similar to the issues encountered on pp.~\pageref{sec:chiao-paradox}ff involving charged particles?\hwendpart
(b) Show that if low-mass, uncharged particles did not follow geodesics (in a spacetime with no ambient electromagnetic
fields), it would violate Lorentz invariance.
Make sure that your argument explicitly invokes the low mass and the lack of charge, because otherwise your
