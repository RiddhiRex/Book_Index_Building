Epsilon-delta proofs are hard work, and by building up a more sophisticated set of tools we can usually avoid having to apply the epsilon-delta definition directly.  < If  and  are constants, then equation   _xac=c  equation and equation   _xa x= a. equation <  < Let  and  be two given functions whose limits for  we know,  _xaF_1(x)=L_1, _xaF_2(x)=L_2.  Then align   _xa(F_1(x)+F_2(x))=L_1+L_2,      _xa(F_1(x)-F_2(x))= L_1 - L_2,      _xa(F_1(x)F_2(x))= L_1L_2  align Finally, if , equation   _xaF_1(x)F_2(x)= L_1L_2. equation     In other words the limit of the sum is the sum of the limits, etc.  One can prove these laws using the definition of the limit, but we will not do this here.  However, I hope these laws seem like common sense: if, for  close to , the quantity  is close to  and  is close to , then certainly  should be close to .  eg In this example we compute several limits, building up from simple examples to more complicated ones.  First let\\'s evaluate  . We have align*   _x2 x^2 &= _x2 xx     &= ( _x2 x)( _x2 x)   &by     &= 22 = 4. align* Similarly, align*   _x2 x^3 &= _x2 xx^2     &= ( _x2 x)( _x2 x^2)   & again    &= 24 = 8, align* and, by   _x2 x^2-1 = _x2 x^2 - _x2 1 = 4-1 = 3,  and, by  again,  _x2 x^3-1 = _x2 x^3 - _x2 1 = 8-1 = 7,  Putting all this together, we get  _x2x^3-1x^2-1 = 2^3-12^2-1 = 8-14-1= 73  because of .  To apply  we must check that the denominator (``\\'\\') is not zero.  Since the denominator is 3, this was all right. eg  egThe limit of a square rooteg:limit-of-sqrt Find .  Of course, you would think that  and you can indeed prove this using   . But is there an easier way?  There is nothing in the limit properties which tells us how to deal with a square root, and using them we can\\'t even prove that there is a limit.  However, if you assume that the limit exists then the limit properties allow us to find this limit.  The argument goes like this: suppose that there is a number  with  _x2 x = L.  Then property  implies that  L^2 = (_x2x)(_x2x) = _x2 xx =_x2x =2.  In other words, , and hence  must be either  or  .  We can reject the latter because whatever  does, its square root is always a positive number, and hence it can never ``get close to\\'\\' a negative number like .   Our conclusion: if the limit exists, then  _x2 x = 2.  The result is not surprising: if  gets close to 2 then  gets close to . eg <  < < In example eg:limit-of-sqrt we worried about the possibility that a limit  actually might not exist.  This can actually happen, and in this section we\\'ll see a few examples of what failed limits look like.  First let\\'s agree on what we will call a ``failed limit.\\'\\'  lessimportant If there is no number  such that , then we say that the limit  does not exist.  lessimportant  < <   fig(     \\'sign-function\\',        )    <  egThe sign function near eg:limit-of-sign-function The ``sign function\\'\\' is defined by  sign (x) = cases   -1 & for   0 & for   1 & for  cases  Note that ``the sign of zero\\'\\' is defined to be zero.  But does the sign function have a limit at , i.e. does  exist? And is it also zero? The answers are no and no, and here is why: suppose that for some number  one had    _x0sign(x) = L,  then since for arbitrary small positive values of  one has   one would think that .  But for arbitrarily small negative values of  one has , so one would conclude that .  But one number  can\\'t be both  and  at the same time, so there is no such , i.e. there is no limit.  _x0 sign (x)  does not exist.   In examples like this one, it is possible to define a one-sided limit; see section subsec:one-sided-limits. eg    <   fig(     \\'backward-sine\\',          #            \\'width\\'=>\\'fullpage\\'        )   egThe ``backward sine\\'\\'eg:backward-sine Figure backward-sine shows the  ``backward sine\\'\\' function . Contemplate its limit as :  _x0(x).   When  the function  is not defined, because its definition involves division by .  What happens to  as ? First,  becomes larger and larger (``goes to infinity\\'\\') as .  Then, taking the sine, we see that  oscillates between  and  infinitely often as .  This means that  gets close to any number between  and  as , but that the function  never stays close to any particular value because it keeps oscillating up and down. The limit fails to exist, but for a different reason than in example eg:limit-of-sign-function. eg  egTrying to divide by zero using a limiteg:limit-to-divide-by-zero The expression  is not defined, but what about  _x01x?  This limit also does not exist.  Here are two reasons:  It is common wisdom that if you divide by a small number you get a large number, so as  the quotient  will not be able to stay close to any particular finite number, and the limit can\\'t exist.  ``Common wisdom\\'\\' is not always a reliable tool in mathematical proofs, so here is a better argument.  The limit can\\'t exist, because that would contradict the limit properties .  Namely, suppose that there were an number  such that  _x0 1 x = L.  Then the limit property  would imply that  _x0(1xx ) = (_x0 1x)(_x0 x) = L0 =0.  On the other hand  so the above limit should be 1!  A                                        number can\\'t be both 0 and 1 at the same time, so we have a contradiction. The assumption that  exists is to blame, so it must go. eg  < The limit properties tell us how to prove that certain limits exist (and how to compute them).  Although it is perhaps not so obvious at first sight, they also allow you to prove that certain limits do not exist.  Example eg:limit-to-divide-by-zero shows one instance of such use.  Here is another.  Property  says that if both  and   exist then  also must exist.  You can turn this around and say that if  does not exist then either  or  does not exist (or both limits fail to exist).  For instance, the limit  _x0 1x-x  can\\'t exist, for if it did, then the limit  _x0 1x =_x0 (+x) =_x 0 (+ _x0 x  would also have to exist, and we know  doesn\\'t exist.  < <  <  Not all limits are ``for \\'\\'.  Here we describe some variations on the concept of limit.  < When we let `` approach \\'\\' we allow  to be larger or smaller  than , as long as  ``gets close to \\'\\'.  If we explicitly want to study the behavior of  as  approaches  through values larger than , then we write  _xa f(x) or  _xa+ f(x)  or  _xa+0 f(x)  or  _xa, x>a f(x).  All four notations are commonly used.  Similarly, to designate the value which    approaches as  approaches  through values below  one writes  _xa f(x) or  _xa- f(x)  or  _xa-0 f(x)  or  _xa, x<a f(x).  The precise definition of these ``one-sided\\'\\' limits goes like this:  important[Definition of right- and left-limits] Let  be a function.  Then the right-limit notation equationeqn:one-sided-lim-formulation   _xa f(x) = L. equation means that for every  one can find a  such that  a<x<a+f(x)-L<  holds for all  in the domain of .  The definition of a left-limit is exactly analogous. When we say equationeqn:left-sided-lim-formulation   _xa f(x) = L, equation we mean that for every  one can find a  such that  a-<x<a f(x)-L<  holds for all  in the domain of . important  The following theorem tells you how to use one-sided limits to decide if a function  has a limit at .  theorem The two-sided limit  exists if and only if the two one-sided limits    _xa f(x), and_xa f(x)  exist and have the same value. theorem  <  < So far we have defined the limit of a function  as  gets closer and closer to some finite value. It can also be of interest to let  become ``larger and larger\\'\\' and ask what happens to .  If there is a number  such that  gets arbitrarily close to  if one chooses  sufficiently large, then we write     _x f(x) = L  (``The limit for  going to infinity is .\\'\\') We have an analogous definition for what happens to  as  becomes very large and negative: we write  _x- f(x) = L    (``The limit for  going to negative infinity is .\\'\\')  Here are the precise definitions:  important[Definitions of limits at infinity] infinite and infinitesimal quantities!limits at infinity Let  be a function which is defined on an interval . If there is a number  such that for every  we can find an  such that  x>A f(x) - L <  for all , then we say that the limit of  for  is .  Similarly, let  be a function which is defined on an interval . If there is a number  such that for every  we can find an  such that  x<-A f(x) - L <  for all , then we say that the limit of  for  is . important  These definitions are very similar to the original definition of the limit in section sec:limit on p. sec:limit. Instead of  which specifies how close  should be to , we now have a number  that says how large  should be, which is a way of saying ``how close  should be to infinity\\'\\' (or to negative infinity).  But although these definitions are similar to the original one, they are not quite the same. Note that there is no real number called , and therefore we can\\'t just take the definition of  and substitute  for .

How do we choose ?   is not allowed to depend on , but it may depend on .  Let\\'s decide that we will always take , so that we only need consider positive values of .  Then eqn:1overx-small-for-x-large simplifies to  1x<  which is equivalent to  x>1.  This tells us how to choose .  Given any positive , we will simply choose    A=  the larger of  0  and  1  Then we have  for all , so we have proved that . eg  The properties of the limit given in section sec:properties-of-the-limit, p. sec:properties-of-the-limit, also apply to limits at infinity. As with limits at finite , it is usually more convenient to calculate limits by using these properties than by direct application of the definition.  egA rational functioneg:rational-function-at-infinity A rational function is the quotient of two polynomials: rational function equation   R(x) = a_nx^n++a_1x+a_0b_mx^m++b_1x+b_0. equation The following trick allows us to evaluate the limit of any such function at infinity.  For example, let\\'s compute  _x3x^2+35x^2+7x-39.  The trick is to factor  from top and bottom. You get align*   _x3x^2+35x^2+7x-39   &= _xx^2x^2  3+3/x^25+7/x-39/x^2   & (algebra)    &= _x(3+3/x^2)_x(5+7/x-39/x^2)   &(limit properties)    &= 35. align* At the end of this computation, we used the limit properties  to break the limit down into simpler pieces like , which we can directly evaluate; for example, we have  _x 39/x^2 =_x 39( 1x )^2 = ( _x39)(   _x1x )^2 = 39 0^2 =0.    The other terms are similar.  eg  egAnother rational function Compute  _x 2x4x^3+5.  We apply the same trick as in example eg:rational-function-at-infinity and factor  out of the numerator and  out of the denominator. This leads to align*   _x 2x4x^3+5   &=_x (xx^324+5/x^3)    &=_x (1x^224+5/x^3)    &=_x (1x^2)(_x24+5/x^3)    &=024    &=0. align*  eg  <  < Figure telephone-wire shows a telephone wire strung between two poles, which sags by some amount  in the middle. By increasing the tension  in the wire, we can reduce the sag. That is, the necessary tension  is some function . There is a story, almost certainly apocryphal, to the effect that a small-town mayor considered the sagging wires unsightly, and instructed the public works department to tighten them up enough so that they wouldn\\'t sag at all. < <   fig(     \\'telephone-wire\\',        )    <  It can be shown that the function  is approximately given by the equation equation*   T = kh, equation* where  is a constant. The value of  is , where  is the weight of the wire and  is the horizontal length. The approximation is good if  is small compared to . When I ask students what happens to this equation when we plug in , I always get a chorus of ``undefined!\\'\\' This shows good mathematical training --- division by zero is indeed undefined --- but doesn\\'t give any real insight into what will go wrong when the workers try to carry out the mayor\\'s plan. If we make  smaller and smaller  will get bigger and bigger. By making  sufficiently small, we can make  arbitrarily large. The important insight here is that a quantity like  isn\\'t just undefined, it\\'s undefined because it\\'s infinity, and infinity isn\\'t a real number. If the workers actually try to make , they will simply have to tighten the wires so much that the wires break.  Another way of putting this is that the limit  fails to exist. Although it\\'s true that the limit doesn\\'t exist, we can be more descriptive about the reason that it doesn\\'t. It\\'s a limit that doesn\\'t exist because it equals infinity.  Consider the limit  _x0 1 x.  As  decreases to  through smaller and smaller positive values, its reciprocal  becomes larger and larger.  We say that instead of going to some finite number, the quantity  ``goes to infinity\\'\\' as .  In symbols: equation   _x0 1 x = .   eqn:03limit-invx-is-infty equation  Likewise, as  approaches  through negative numbers, its reciprocal  drops lower and lower, and we say that  ``goes to \\'\\' as .  Symbolically, equation   eqn:03limit-invx-is-neg-infty     _x0 1 x = -. equation The limits eqn:03limit-invx-is-infty and eqn:03limit-invx-is-neg-infty are not like the normal limits we have been dealing with so far.  Namely, when we write something like  _x2 x^2 = 4  we mean that the limit actually exists and that it is equal to . On the other hand, since we have agreed that  is not a number (see p. infinity-is-not-a-hyperreal), the meaning of eqn:03limit-invx-is-infty cannot be to say that ``the limit exists and its value is .\\'\\'   < <   fig(     \\'limit-of-one-over-x\\',        )    <  Instead, when we write equation   _xa f(x) =    eqn:03limit-of-f-infty equation for some function , we mean, by definition, that the limit of  does not exist, and that it fails to exist in a specific way: as , the value of  becomes ``larger and larger,\\'\\' and in fact eventually becomes larger than any finite number.  The language in that last paragraph shows you that this is an intuitive definition, at the same level as the first definition of limit we gave in section subsec:limit-informal, p. subsec:limit-informal.  It contains the    usual suspect phrases such as ``larger and larger,\\'\\' or ``finite number\\'\\' (as if there were any other kind.)  A more precise definition involving epsilons can be given, but in this course we will not go into this much detail.  When a function is going to blow up at a certain point, there are two common behaviors. The first is the one shown in figure limit-of-one-over-x for , where the limit is  on one side and  on the other. If a limit is to be more than a one-sided limit, we want it to have the same value on the left and right. In this example that doesn\\'t happen, so only the one-sided limits can be described as being positive- or negative-infinite: align*   & _x0 1x = +    & _x0  1x = -    & _x0  1x  can\\'t be described as  or   align* The function , figure limit-of-one-over-x-squared, exhibits the other frequently encountered behavior. Here we have a positive blowup on both sides, so it isn\\'t just the one-sided limits that can be described. align*   & _x0 1x^2 = +    & _x0  1x^2 = +    & _x0  1x^2 = + align*   As a final comment on infinite limits, it is important to realize that eqn:03limit-of-f-infty is not a normal limit, and you cannot apply the limit rules to infinite   limits.   Here is an example of what goes wrong if you try anyway.   < <   fig(     \\'limit-of-one-over-x-squared\\',              positive infinity on both sides.   )    <  egTrouble with infinite limits If you apply the limit properties to , then you could conclude  1 = _x0 x1 x  = _x0 x _x0  1 x  = 0   = 0,  because ``anything multiplied with zero is zero.\\'\\'  After using the limit properties in combination with this infinite limit we reach the absurd conclusion that .  The moral of this story is that you can\\'t use the limit properties when some of the limits are infinite. eg   <  <  < < The concepts of calculus, such as derivatives, limits, curvature, and concavity, can guide us in analyzing the behavior of a function even when we don\\'t know a formula for the function. In economics, for example, these concepts are used heavily even though real-world data can essentially never be described by a formula. This subsection presents four examples in which we can use these concepts to sketch a function based on our understanding of how the function should behave in real life.  < Most people will end up borrowing money at some point in their lives, whether it\\'s credit card debt, a mortgage, a loan to buy a car, or a cash advance from a payday loan company. One of the warning signs that you may be walking into an exploitative situation is if the person trying to sell you the loan emphasizes the low monthly payment. Suppose that you\\'re borrowing 10,000 to buy a car, and the monthly interest rate is 1. Let  be the monthly payment, and  the time required in order to pay off the loan. To understand what\\'s going on here, you want to be able to visualize the graph of  as a function of . One fairly tedious way to do this would be to find the equation of the function, take a piece of graph paper and plot points. Another method would be to use an expensive graphing calculator. But your knowledge of calculus gives you a method that provides more insight with less work.  Clearly the smaller the payment, the longer it will take to pay off the loan. This tells us that  is a decreasing function; its derivative will always be negative.  If  is large, then you will pay off the loan so quickly that no significant amount of interest accrues. Therefore at large values of , we will have . This tells us that . The graph of  will approach the horizontal axis more and more closely as  gets bigger and bigger. We say that the function  has a horizontal asymptote at zero. < <   fig(     \\'loan-period\\',        )    <  Finally, what happens if  is small? Remember, interest on the loan is accruing at a rate of 1 monthly, or 100 every month. It may sound like a good deal if you\\'re offered this loan with a low monthly payment of 101, but if you take the loan and always make the minimum payment, then the principal on the loan will only go down by 1 every month. You will die of old age before you pay off the car. We can therefore tell that . This is a vertical asymptote on the graph. <  Figure loan-period shows what the graph must look like.  < This example, a famous one, also has to do with money. In 1974, economist Arthur Laffer presented the following argument about taxes to politicians Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, sketching the resulting graph on a paper napkin. Consider the government\\'s tax revenue as a function of the tax rate. Clearly if the tax rate is zero, the government gets zero revenue. Most people would assume that the function was a purely increasing one, since raising the tax rate would always garner the government more money.  < <   fig(     \\'laffer-curve\\',        )    <  But, Laffer said, that isn\\'t so. Imagine that the tax rate was 100, so that the government confiscated all of everyone\\'s earnings. Nobody would have any incentive to work, so they would stop working, they would earn no taxable income, and revenue would drop to zero. Laffer sketched a graph like figure laffer-curve on a paper napkin for Cheney and Rumsfeld. There should be some intermediate tax rate, he told them, that would produce the maximum revenue. Later, when Ronald Reagan became president, he cut taxes on the theory that the US was already on the right-hand side of the ``Laffer curve,\\'\\' so that, counterintuitively, the lower taxes would produce higher revenue. The results were not as Laffer had promised; the average annual budget deficit during the Reagan administration was 240 billion, compared to 57 billion during the preceding Carter administration.  In calculus terms, our analysis of this function is an example of a result called Rolle\\'s theorem, p. subsec:rolle. The idea is that if the function is smooth, then we expect its derivative to be continuous. If the derivative is positive on the left and negative on the right, then it must be zero at some intermediate point. This would be the point at which the function was maximized. <  < Figure skydiving shows a skydiver\\'s altitude as a function of time. Early in the motion, soon after the person jumps out of the plane, the only significant force is gravity, and the person falls with constant acceleration (section subsec:velocity, p. subsec:velocity). The drop relative to the initial position equals , which is the equation of a parabola.  < <   fig(     \\'skydiving\\',        )    <  < <   fig(     \\'anchor\\',        )    <  But as the downward (negative) velocity increases, the upward force of air friction gets stronger and stronger. In the opposite limit of , the force of air friction gets closer and closer to being strong enough to cancel the force of gravity. In this limit, Newton\\'s second law (section subsec:newton-second-law, p. subsec:newton-second-law) predicts an acceleration of zero. An acceleration of zero corresponds to constant velocity, so that the graph asymptotically approaches a line whose slope is the velocity.  This graph demonstrates two mathematical properties. It has a y-intercept, which is the initial altitude. It also has an oblique asymptote, i.e., an asymptotic line that is neither horizontal nor vertical. <  < For safety, rock climbers and mountaineers often wear a climbing harness and tie in to other climbers on a rope team or to anchors such as pitons or snow anchors. When using anchors, the climber usually wants to be protected by more than one, both for extra strength and for redundancy in case one fails. Figure anchor shows such an arrangement, with the climber hanging from a pair of anchors forming a ``Y\\'\\' at an angle .  The usual advice is to make ; for large values of , the stress placed on the anchors can be many times greater than the actual load , so that two anchors are actually less safe than one.  Consider the stress on the anchor  as a function of . For physical reasons similar to those discussed in the example of the telephone wire (section subsec:limit-equals-infinity, p. subsec:limit-equals-infinity),  must approach infinity as  approaches 180 degrees; no matter how tight the anchor strands are made, the carabiner (hook) at the center will never be pulled up quite as high as the anchors.  At , we can see that each anchor strand will support half the load. The y-intercept of the graph equals .  We can gain further insight by extending the range of possible values for  to include negative angles. Physically, this corresponds to bringing the anchor strands past one another and swapping the roles of the two anchors. Since the physical setup is symmetrical, the function  must have the property , i.e., it is an even function. It might seem pointless to discuss this symmetry, but it tells us something important. An argument identical to the one in section subsec:derivative-of-x-squared, p. subsec:derivative-of-x-squared, tells us that based on this symmetry, the derivative  must equal zero at . This means that for small values of , the strain on the anchor will be very nearly the same as for , i.e., hardly any greater than half the load. Thus any small value of  is about equally good, but very large values could be a deadly mistake. <   < < In figure beer-sketching we revisit the example of fermenting beer (section sec:changing-change, p. sec:changing-change). (Feel free to mark your place in the book and make a trip to the fridge before continuing.) The top panel of the graph would probably have been the easiest to sketch starting from scratch. Clearly the amount of  produced starts off at zero, it rises, and it must eventually flatten out and approach a horizontal asymptote, since the yeast use up all their food and can\\'t produce any more. This kind of vaguely S-shaped curve is in fact encountered in many situations, and is often referred to as a ``yeast curve.\\'\\' < <   fig(     \\'beer-sketching\\',        )    <  Now suppose we know  and we want to find  and . The basic concept is that the slope of each graph in the stack gives the value of the graph below it. The slope of the tangent line to the  graph at time A is small and positive, while the slope at B is larger and positive. Therefore the values of  at these times must be small and positive, then larger and positive. At time C, the slope of the  graph is as great as it will ever be. Therefore the  graph has a maximum there. The slope of  gets smaller at D and still smaller at E, so the value of  must taper off correspondingly.  Now that we\\'ve sketched the graph of , we can continue the process and construct its derivative, . At time C the slope of the  graph is zero, so the value of the  graph is zero; this is a point of inflection. At times earlier than C the slope of  is positive, while at times later than C it\\'s negative. Therefore we must have  before C and  after.  We can also relate the properties of the  graph directly to those of the  graph. The second derivative is a measure of curvature, and its sign indicates concavity. The  graph is concave up before C and concave down after. This matches up with the signs of .    dqdq:inconsistent-graphs Figure dq-inconsistent-graphs shows three stacks of graphs, each of which is supposed to represent the position, velocity, and acceleration of an object.

Often we are especially interested in finding the function\\'s local maxima and minima, including the absolute or global maxima and minima. That is, the absolute maximum is the greatest value ever attained by the function, and similarly for the absolute minimum.  enumerate Find all solutions of  in the interval : these are called   the critical or stationary points for . Find the sign of  at all other points. Each stationary point at which  actually changes sign is a local   maximum or local minimum.  Compute  at each   stationary point. Compute the  values of the function  and  at the endpoints of the interval. The absolute maximum is attained at the stationary point or the boundary   point with the highest value of ; the absolute minimum occurs at the   boundary or stationary point with the smallest value. enumerate If the interval is unbounded, then instead of computing the values  or ,  you should instead compute .  As an example, let\\'s sketch the graph of the rational function  f(x) = x(3-4x)1+x^2.  By looking at the signs of numerator and denominator we see that center    for      for  and also for . center We compute the derivative of :  f\\'(x) = -3x^2-8x+3(1+x^2)^2.  Hence   if and only if  -3x^2-8x+3 = 0,  and the solutions to this quadratic equation are  and .    These two    roots will appear several times, and it will shorten our formulas if we abbreviate    A= -3  and  B= 1/3.   To see if the derivative changes sign we factor the numerator and denominator. The denominator is always positive, and the numerator is  -3x^2-8x+3 = -3(x^2+83x-1) =-3(x-A)(x-B).  Therefore  f\\'(x) cases   <0 & for x<A     >0 &for  A<x<B     <0 &for  x>B cases  It follows that  is decreasing on the interval , increasing on the interval  and decreasing again on the interval  (figure curve-sketching-signs-of-derivative). Therefore center    is a local minimum, and  is a local maximum. center Are these global maxima and minima?  < <   fig(     \\'curve-sketching-signs-of-derivative\\',        )    <  Since we are dealing with an unbounded interval we must compute the limits of  as .  We find  _x f(x) = _xf(x) = -4.  Since  is decreasing between  and , it follows that  f(A) f(x) < - 4  for  -<xA.  Similarly,  is decreasing from  to , so  -4 < f(x) f(B)  for  B < x<.  Between the two stationary points the function is increasing, so  f(A) f(x) f(B)  for  AxB.  From this it follows that  has a global minimum when  and has a global maximum when .    <   fig(     \\'curve-sketching-rational\\',                 \\'width\\'=>\\'wide\\',       \\'sidecaption\\'=>true        )    < <  < < Calculus is the study of rates of change (differentiation) and how change accumulates (integration, which we haven\\'t encountered yet). What changes is always a function, and the function takes an input value that belongs to its domain and gives back an output that belongs to its range. The domain and range could in principle be sets of integers, rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, or hyperreal numbers (section sec:safe-handling-of-dx, p. sec:safe-handling-of-dx). These number systems all share many of the same properties, but  just as the ocean is the natural setting for a pirate story, there is a sense in which the real numbers are the natural setting in which to do calculus. Throughout this book, without specifically commenting on it so far, we\\'ve been considering only functions that take real-number inputs and give back real-number outputs: real functions.   < <   fig(     \\'cannonball-hits-water\\',        )    <    What\\'s so special about real functions? We can define functions whose inputs and outputs are, say, integers, and such functions are of interest in many fields of mathematics. But real functions are especially well suited to describing rates of change. As an example, the graph in figure cannonball-hits-water shows the function . Let\\'s say this represents the arc of a cannon-ball shot off of a cliff into the ocean, where a  coordinate of  represents the surface of the water. Our geometrical intuition tells us that if the ball starts above the water, and later on ends up below it, then there must be some point at which it enters the water. In other words, if the graph of the function  cuts across the line , then there must be a point at which they coincide.  But if we consider a set of numbers more restricted than the    real numbers, this may not happen. For example, suppose we take  to be a function whose inputs and outputs are rational numbers. Recall that a rational number is any number that can be expressed as an integer divided by another integer, e.g., the fraction 2/3. But the place where our cannonball crosses sea level has , which is  not a rational number. This example shows that the graphs of two rational-number functions can cut across one another without ever touching! This offends our intuition about rates of change, since we expect that if we change a variable smoothly from one value to another, it should visit every value in between.  What is the special ingredient, the secret sauce that allows the real number system to avoid such paradoxical results as the one about the cannonball? It seems that the reals are somehow more densely packed on the number line than the rationals, but how do we define this density property in mathematical terms? It can\\'t be any of the elementary properties of the reals (section sec:elementary-reals, p. sec:elementary-reals), since the rationals also satisfy all of those properties. We need to add a new axiom, which is called the completeness axiom.  One possible way of stating such an axiom is the following.   important[Completeness axiom] Let P and Q be sets of  numbers such that every number in P is smaller than every number in Q. Then there exists some  number  such that  is greater than or equal to every number in P, but less than or equal to any number in Q. important completenessseereal numbers  < <   fig(     \\'cannonball-completeness\\',                By the completeness axiom, a number like  exists.        2. By the completeness axiom, the curve  must intersect the axis. The point of intersection is           . The completeness axiom doesn\\'t hold for the rational numbers, and we can see that here because            is an irrational number.   )    <  As an example, let P be the set of all numbers  such that , and Q the set of  such that . Then the number  would have to be , which shows that the rationals are not complete. The reals are complete, and the completeness axiom can serve as one of the fundamental axioms of the real numbers.  -5    -5  The completeness axiom is of a fundamentally different character than the elementary axioms. The elementary axioms make statements such as ``for any number , or ``for any numbers  and , The completeness axiom says ``for any sets of numbers P and Q,     egEvery decimal is a real number Consider the infinite decimal equation*   3.141592, equation* which is the decimal expansion of . We can use the completeness axiom to prove that this is a real number. Let P be the list of rational numbers given by . Let Q be the set of rational numbers that are larger than every number in P. Then the real number whose existence is asserted by the completeness axiom is exactly . Similar reasoning shows that any decimal corresponds to some real number (which can be shown to be unique). (Note, however, that the same real number can have more than one decimal expansion. For example, the infinite repeating decimals  and  both equal 1.) eg    egThe Archimedean propertyeg:archimedean real numbers!Archimedean property The Archimedean principle states that there is no positive real number that is less than , less than , less than , and so on. Cf. section sec:safe-handling-of-dx, p. sec:safe-handling-of-dx. For an application  to economics, see rule 3, p. vnm-axioms. In other words, it says that there are no real numbers that are infinitely small, but still greater than zero. The Archimedean property can be proved from the completeness property. For suppose, to the contrary, that we did have such a real number. Then it would be less than , so its first decimal place would be 0. It would also be less than , so its second decimal place would also be zero. Continuing in this way, we find that the decimal expansion of such a number must be , with the zeroes repeating forever. But this is the decimal expansion of zero, and we already know that every decimal expansion corresponds to a unique real number. Therefore our number is zero, and this is a contradiction, since we assumed that it violated the Archimedean principle, which refers to a positive real number. eg  < < The following two theorems can be proved from the completeness property and the elementary properties of the reals, but we will not give the proofs here.  < Intuitively, the intermediate value theorem intermediate value theorem says that the real numbers aren\\'t susceptible to paradoxes like the cannonball paradox described above. Or, we can say that if you are moving continuously along a road,  and you get from point A to point B, then you must also visit every other point along the road; only by teleporting (by moving discontinuously) could you avoid doing so. More formally, the theorem says this: < <   fig(     \\'intermediate-value-theorem\\',        )    <  theorem[Intermediate value theorem] If  is a continuous real-valued function on the real interval from  to , and if  takes on values  and  at certain points within this interval, then for any  between  and , there is some real  in the interval for which . theorem  eg Show that there is a solution to the equation .  We expect there to be a solution near , where the function  is just a little too big. On the other hand,  is much too small. Since  has values above and below 1000 on the interval from 2 to 3, and  is continuous, the intermediate value theorem proves that a solution exists between 2 and 3. If we wanted to find a better numerical approximation to the solution, we could do it using Newton\\'s method, which is introduced in section sec:newtons-method. eg    < <   fig(     \\'x-minus-cos-x\\',        )    <  egeg:x-minus-cos-x Show that there is at least one solution to the equation , and give bounds on its location.  This is what\\'s known as a transcendental equation, and no amount of fiddling with algebra and trig identities will ever give a closed-form solution, i.e., one that can be written down with a finite number of arithmetic operations to give an exact result. However, we can easily prove that at least one solution exists, by applying the intermediate value theorem to the function . The cosine function is bounded between  and 1, so  must be negative for  and positive for . By the intermediate value theorem, there must be a solution in the interval . The graph, x-minus-cos-x, verifies this, and shows that there is only one solution. eg     egSupply and demandeg:supply-and-demand supply and demand market equilibrium Figure eg-supply-and-demand shows two graphs representing the supply and demand of some good on a free market. The function  shows the quantity that buyers would willingly buy at unit price . Normally  is a decreasing function: if the price goes up, people don\\'t buy as much. (But cf. problem hw:perfectly-inelastic-demand, p. hw:perfectly-inelastic-demand.) The function  shows the quantity that the seller would willingly offer if the unit price was . Often  is an increasing function. For example, Boeing might only be able to produce more passenger jets by paying their workers overtime, which would create a cost that they would pass on to their customers.  Suppose that, as in the example shown in the figure,  starts out higher than  on the left, but ends up lower than  on the right. Then we expect geometrically that if the curves are continuous, they must cross at some point. This can be proved using the same technique as in example eg:x-minus-cos-x. We construct a function , which goes from negative to positive. By the intermediate value theorem, there must be some point where , meaning that . This crossing point is the free-market equilibrium.  The intermediate value theorem holds for real numbers, but in fact neither the price nor the quantity is free to have any real-number value. For example, Boeing can\\'t sell half an airplane. In some cases this might mean that the free-market equilibrium defined by  would not exist. An example might be the Concorde, a supersonic passenger jet, which flew from 1969 to 2003. The nonexistence of the market for this plane today may indicate that the supply and demand curves now cross at a quantity that is greater than 0 and less than 1, which is not a possible free-market equilibrium because the planes can only be sold in whole numbers. eg   < <   fig(     \\'eg-supply-and-demand\\',        )    <  eg Prove that every odd-order polynomial  with real coefficients has at least one real root , i.e., a point at which .   Example eg:x-minus-cos-x might have given the impression that there was nothing to be learned from the intermediate value theorem that couldn\\'t be determined by graphing, but this example clearly can\\'t be solved by graphing, because we\\'re trying to prove a general result for all polynomials.  To see that the restriction to odd orders is necessary, consider the polynomial , which has no real roots because  for any real number .  To fix our minds on a concrete example for the odd case, consider the polynomial . For large values of , the linear and constant terms will be negligible compared to the  term, and since  is positive for large values of  and negative for large negative ones, it follows that  is sometimes positive and sometimes negative. Therefore by the intermediate value theorem  has at least one root.  This argument didn\\'t depend much on the specific polynomial  chosen as an example. The fact that  was positive for large  and negative for large negative  followed merely from the fact that  was of odd order. Therefore the result holds for all polynomials of odd order. eg  egeg:x-minus-sin-1-over-x Show that the equation  has infinitely many solutions.  This is another example that can\\'t be solved by graphing; there is clearly no way to prove, just by looking at a graph like x-minus-sin-1-over-x, that  the function  crosses the  axis infinitely many times. The graph does, however, help us to gain intuition for what\\'s going on. As  gets smaller and smaller,  blows up, and  oscillates more and more rapidly. The function  is undefined at 0, but it\\'s continuous everywhere else, so we can apply the intermediate value theorem to any interval that doesn\\'t include 0.  We want to prove that for any positive , there exists an  with  for which  has either desired sign. Let  be an even integer such that  and also . Then clearly  is negative at , since  and  is small. Similarly,  is positive at . This establishes the desired result. eg < <   fig(     \\'x-minus-sin-1-over-x\\',        )    <     < <  We\\'ve seen that that locating maxima and minima of functions may in general be fairly difficult, because there are so many different ways in which a function can attain an extremum: e.g., at an endpoint, at a place where its derivative is zero, or at a nondifferentiable kink. The following theorem allows us to make a very general statement about all these possible cases, assuming only continuity.  theorem[Extreme value theorem]extreme-value-theorem If  is a continuous real-valued function on the real-number interval defined by , then  has maximum and minimum values on that interval, which are attained at specific points in the interval. extreme value theorem theorem  Let\\'s first see why the assumptions are necessary. If we weren\\'t confined to a finite interval, then  would be a counterexample, because it\\'s continuous and doesn\\'t have any maximum or minimum value. If we didn\\'t assume continuity, then we could have a function defined as  for , and  for ; this function never gets bigger than 1, but it never attains a value of 1 for any specific value of . If we didn\\'t assume a real function, then we could have, for example, the function  defined on  the rational numbers, which would never attain the minimum value of 0 because  isn\\'t a rational number.  eg Find the maximum value of the polynomial  for .  Polynomials are continuous, so the extreme value theorem guarantees that such a maximum exists. Suppose we try to find it by looking for a place where the derivative is zero. The derivative is , and setting it equal to zero gives a quadratic equation, but application of the quadratic formula shows that it has no real solutions. It appears that the function doesn\\'t have a maximum anywhere (even outside the interval of interest) that looks like a smooth peak. Since it doesn\\'t have kinks or discontinuities, there is only one other type of maximum it could have, which is a maximum at one of its endpoints. Plugging in the limits, we find  and , so we conclude that the maximum value on this interval is 156. eg <  < < On p. subsubsec:laffer-curve, in the example of the Laffer curve from economics, we got a preview of the following intuitively appealing theorem.  < <   fig(     \\'rolle\\',        )    <  theorem[Rolle\\'s theorem] Rolle\\'s theorem Let  be a function that is continuous on the interval  and differentiable on , and let . There there exists a point  such that . theorem  Proof: By the extreme value theorem,  attains its maximum and minimum values in . If both of these are at endpoints, then  is a constant function, and the theorem holds trivially. Suppose instead that at least one of these extrema is on the interior of the interval. Then by the theorem given in section subsec:zero-deriv-at-extremum,  is zero at that point, and the theorem also holds.  Rolle\\'s theorem can be straightforwardly generalized to the following.  < <   fig(     \\'mean-value\\',        )    <  theorem[Mean value theorem] mean value theorem Let  be a function that is continuous on the interval  and differentiable on . There there exists a point  such that equation*   f\\'(x) = f(b)-f(a)b-a, equation* meaning that the derivative equals the average (mean) rate of change of the function between the endpoints of the interval. theorem  ``Mean\\'\\' is just a fancy word for ``average.\\'\\' In general, it\\'s a mistake to try to calculate a rate of change without calculus, using , unless the rate of change is constant. The mean value theorem says that just as a broken clock is right twice a day, there is at least one point where  gives the right answer.  Proof: Define the function equation*   (x)=a+f(b)-f(a)b-a(x-a), equation* which is the point-slope form of the line passing through the endpoints of the graph of . Define a new function , so that . Applying Rolle\\'s theorem to , we find that there is some point where , which is the desired result. < < < < Suppose we want to compute the following limit: equation*   _x2 x^2-2xx^2-4 equation* We first use the limit properties to find  _x2 x^2-2x = 0  and _x2x^2 - 4 = 0.  Now to complete the computation we would like to apply the property  about quotients, but this would give us  _x2 f(x) = 00.  The denominator is zero, so we were not allowed to use  (and the result doesn\\'t mean anything anyway).  We have to do something else.  The function we are dealing with is a rational function, which means, as mentioned in example eg:rational-function-at-infinity, p. eg:rational-function-at-infinity, that it is the quotient of two polynomials.  For such functions there is an algebra trick that always allows you to compute the limit even if you first get .  The thing to do is to divide numerator and denominator by .  In our case we have  x^2-2x = (x-2)x, x^2-4 = (x-2)(x+2)  so that  _x2 f(x) =_x2 (x-2)x  (x-2)(x+2) = _x2 xx+2.  After this simplification we can use the properties  to compute  _x2 f(x) = 22+2 = 12.   < < In this section we describe a trick, the ``don\\'t make  to too big\\'\\' trick, that is sometimes helpful when we want to evaluate a limit directly from the epsilon-delta definition. Say we want to prove that . This may not seem to require a fancy proof, since obviously plugging in  gives . But since functions can be discontinuous, plugging in does not always prove the value of a limit. Also, this example will be an excuse to develop a technique that can be useful in less trivial cases.  We have , , , and as usual when computing a limit the question is, ``how small should  be to guarantee ?\\'\\'  We begin by estimating the difference   x^2-1 = (x-1)(x+1) = x+1x-1.  As  approaches 1 the factor  becomes small, and if the other factor  were a constant (e.g.  as in the previous example) then we could find  as before, by dividing  by that constant.  Here is a trick that allows you to replace the factor  with a constant.  We hereby agree that we always choose our  so that .  If we do that, then we will always have  x-1<1, i.e. x-1<1,  and  will always be between  and . Therefore  x^2-1 = x+1x-1<3x-1.  If we now want to be sure that , then this calculation shows that we should require , i.e. .  So we should choose  .  We must also live up to our promise never to choose , so if we are handed an  for which , then we choose  instead of  .  To summarize, we are going to choose  = the smaller of 1 and 13.  We have shown that if you choose  this way, then  implies , no matter what  is.                                                                                                                   The expression ``the smaller of  and \\'\\' shows up often, and is abbreviated to .  We could therefore say that in this problem we will choose  to be  = (1, 13 ).   eg Show that .  We apply the definition with ,  and . Thus, for any  we try to show that if  is small enough then one has .  We begin by estimating  in terms of :  f(x)-1/4 = =  4-x4x = x-44x =14xx-4.  As before, things would be easier if  were a constant.  To achieve that we again agree not to take .  If we always have  , then we will always have , and hence .  How large can  be in this situation?  Answer: the quantity  increases as you decrease , so if  then it will never be larger than .  We see that if we never choose , we will always have  f(x) - 14112x-4 forx-4<.  To guarantee that  we could therefore require  112 x-4<, i.e.x-4 <12.  Hence if we choose  or any smaller number, then  implies .  Of course we have to honor our agreement never to choose , so our choice of  is  = the smaller of 1 and 12= (1, 12).  eg  < <   <  < <    <  <  < < < <   < <  < < <    <  < < <    <  <  < <   fig(     \\'hw-rod-finger-string\\',        )     <   fig(     \\'hw-x-graph-to-v-graph\\',        )    <    <  < < <    <  <    <    <      <  <  < '\n"
