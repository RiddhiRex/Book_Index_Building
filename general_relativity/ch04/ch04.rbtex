We now have enough machinery to be able to calculate quite a bit of interesting physics, and to be sure
that the results are actually meaningful in a relativistic context. The strategy is to identify relativistic
quantities that behave as Lorentz scalars and Lorentz vectors, and then combine them in various ways.
The notion of a tensor has been introduced on page \pageref{tensor-intro}. 
A Lorentz scalar is a tensor of rank 0, and a Lorentz vector is a rank-1 tensor.

<% begin_sec("Lorentz scalars") %>
A Lorentz scalar is a quantity that remains invariant under both spatial rotations and Lorentz boosts.
Mass is a Lorentz scalar.\footnote{Some older books define mass as transforming according to $m \rightarrow \gamma m$,
which can be made to give a self-consistent theory, but is ugly.} Electric charge is also a Lorentz scalar, as demonstrated
to extremely high precision by experiments measuring the electrical neutrality of atoms and molecules to a relative precision of better than
$10^{-20}$; the electron in a hydrogen atom has typically velocities of about $1/100$, and those in heavier elements
such as uranium are highly relativistic, so any violation of Lorentz invariance would give the atoms a nonvanishing
net electric charge.

The time measured by a clock traveling along a particular world-line from one event to another
is something that all observers will agree upon; they will simply note the mismatch with their own clocks. It is therefore
a Lorentz scalar. This
clock-time as measured by a clock attached to the moving body in question is often referred to as proper time,\index{proper time}
``proper'' being used here in the somewhat archaic sense of ``own'' or ``self,'' as in ``The Vatican does not lie
within Italy proper.'' Proper time, which we notate $\tau$, can only be defined for timelike world-lines, since
a lightlike or spacelike world-line isn't possible for a material clock.

More generally,
when we express a metric as $\der s^2=\ldots$, the quantity $\der s$ is a Lorentz scalar. In the special
case of a timelike world-line, $\der s$ and $\der\tau$ are the same thing. (In books that use
a $-+++$ metric, one has $\der s=-\der\tau$.)

Even more generally, affine parameters, which exist independent of any metric at all, are scalars.
As a trivial example, if $\tau$ is a particular object's proper time, then $\tau$ is a valid affine
parameter, but so is $2\tau+7$. Less trivially, a photon's proper time is always zero, but
one can still define an affine parameter along its trajectory. We will need such an affine parameter,
for example, in section \ref{sec:deflection-of-light}, page \pageref{sec:deflection-of-light}, when
we calculate the deflection of light rays by the sun, one of the early classic experimental tests of general relativity.

Another example of a Lorentz scalar is the pressure of a perfect fluid, which is often assumed
as a description of matter in cosmological models.

\begin{eg}{Infinitesimals and the clock ``postulate''}\index{clock ``postulate''}
At the beginning of chapter \ref{ch:differential-geometry}, I motivated the use of infinitesimals
as useful tools for doing differential geometry in curved spacetime. Even in the context of special
relativity, however, infinitesimals can be useful. One way of expressing the proper
time accumulated on a moving clock is
\begin{align*}
  s &= \int \der s \\
    &= \int \sqrt{g_{ij} \der x^i \der x^j} \\
    &= \int \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{\der x}{\der t}\right)^2-\left(\frac{\der y}{\der t}\right)^2-\left(\frac{\der z}{\der t}\right)^2} \der t\eqquad,
\end{align*}
which only contains an explicit dependence on the clock's velocity, not its acceleration.
This is an example of the clock ``postulate'' referred to in the remark at the end of homework problem \ref{hw:clock-postulate}
on page \pageref{hw:clock-postulate}. Note that the clock postulate only applies in the limit of a small clock.
This is represented in the above equation by the use of infinitesimal quantities like $\der x$.

<% begin_sec("The velocity and acceleration four-vectors") %>\label{sec:v-four-vector}\index{four-vector!velocity}\index{velocity four-vector}
Our basic Lorentz vector is the spacetime displacement $\der x^i$. Any other quantity that has the same behavior
as $\der x^i$ under rotations and boosts is also a valid Lorentz vector. Consider a particle moving through space,
as described in a Lorentz frame. Since the particle may be subject to nongravitational forces, the Lorentz frame
cannot be made to coincide (except perhaps momentarily) with the particle's rest frame.
If $\der x^i$ is not lightlike, then the corresponding infinitesimal proper time interval $\der\tau$ is
nonzero. As with Newtonian three-vectors, dividing a four-vector by a Lorentz scalar produces another
quantity that transforms as a four-vector, so
dividing the infinitesimal displacement
by a nonzero infinitesimal proper time interval, we have
the four-velocity vector $v^i=\der x^i/\der\tau$,\index{velocity vector}
whose components in a Lorentz coordinate system
are $(\gamma,\gamma u^1,\gamma u^2,\gamma u^3)$, where $(u^1,u^2,u^3)$
is the ordinary three-component velocity vector as defined in classical
mechanics. The four-velocity's squared magnitude $v^iv_i$ is
always exactly 1, even though the particle is not moving at the speed of light. (If it were moving at the
speed of light, we would have $\der\tau=0$, and $v$ would be undefined.)

When we hear something referred to as a ``vector,''
we usually take this is a statement that it not only transforms as a vector, but also that it adds as a vector.
But we have already seen in section \ref{sec:velocity-addition} on page \pageref{sec:velocity-addition} that even collinear
velocities in relativity do not add linearly; therefore they clearly cannot add linearly when dressed in the clothing of four-vectors.
We've also seen in section \ref{sec:boosts-causing-rotations} that the combination of
non-collinear boosts is noncommutative, and is generally equivalent to a boost plus a spatial rotation; this is also not
consistent with linear addition of four-vectors. At the risk of beating a dead horse, a four-velocity's squared magnitude is
always 1, and this is not consistent with being able to add four-velocity vectors.

\begin{eg}{A zero velocity vector?}\label{eg:zero-v-vector}
\egquestion Suppose an object has a certain four-velocity $v^i$ in a certain frame of reference. Can we transform into a different
frame in which the object is at rest, and its four-velocity is zero?

\eganswer No. In general, the Lorentz transformation preserves the magnitude of vectors, so it can never transform a vector with
a zero magnitude into one with nonzero magnitude. Since this is a material object
(not a ray of light) we can transform into a frame in which the object is at rest,
but an object at rest does not have a vanishing four-velocity. It has a four-velocity
of $(1,0,0,0)$.
\end{eg}

Example \ref{eg:zero-v-vector} suggests a nice way of thinking about velocity vectors, which is that every
velocity vector represents a potential observer.
An observer is a material object, and therefore has a timelike velocity vector. This observer writes her own
velocity vector as  $(1,0,0,0)$, i.e., as the unit vector in the timelike direction. Often when we see an expression
involving a velocity vector, we can interpret it as describing a measurement taken by a specific observer.

\begin{eg}{Orthogonality as simultaneity}\index{orthogonality}
In a space where the inner product can be negative, orthogonality doesn't mean what our euclidean intuition thinks it
means. For example, a lightlike vector can be orthogonal to itself --- a situation that never occurs in a euclidean space.

Suppose we have a timelike vector $\vc{t}$ and a spacelike one $\vc{x}$. What would it mean for $\vc{t}$
and $\vc{x}$ to be orthogonal, with $\vc{t}\cdot\vc{x}=0$? Since $\vc{t}$ is timelike, we can make a unit
vector $\hat{\vc{t}}=\vc{t}/|\vc{t}|$ out of it, and interpret $\hat{\vc{t}}$
as the velocity vector of some hypothetical observer. We then know that in that observer's frame, $\hat{\vc{t}}$
is simply a unit vector along the time axis. It now becomes clear that $\vc{x}$ must be parallel to the x axis,
i.e., it represents a displacement between two events that this observer considers to be simultaneous.

This is an example of the idea that expressions involving velocity vectors can be interpreted as measurements taken
by a certain observer. The expression $\vc{t}\cdot\vc{x}=0$ can be interpreted as meaning that
according to an observer whose world-line is tangent to $\vc{t}$, $\vc{x}$ represents a relationship of simultaneity.
\end{eg}

The four-acceleration is found by taking a second derivative with respect to proper time.\index{four-vector!acceleration}\index{acceleration four-vector}
Its squared magnitude is
only approximately equal to minus the squared magnitude of the Newtonian acceleration three-vector, in the limit of small velocities.

\begin{eg}{Constant acceleration}\label{eg:hyperbolic-motion}
\egquestion Suppose a spaceship moves so that the acceleration is judged to be the constant value $a$ by an observer on board. Find the
motion $x(t)$ as measured by an observer in an inertial frame.

\eganswer Let $\tau$ stand for the ship's proper time, and let dots indicate derivatives with respect to $\tau$.
The ship's velocity has magnitude 1, so
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{t}^2-\dot{x}^2 = 1\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
An observer who is instantaneously at rest with respect to the ship judges is to have a four-acceleration $(0,a,0,0)$
(because the low-velocity limit applies).
The observer in the $(t,x)$ frame agrees on the magnitude of this vector, so
\begin{equation*}
  \ddot{t}^2-\ddot{x}^2=-a^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The solution of these differential equations is $t=\frac{1}{a}\sinh a\tau$, \linebreak[4] $x=\frac{1}{a}\cosh a\tau$, and eliminating
$\tau$ gives
\begin{equation*}
  x = \frac{1}{a}\sqrt{1+a^2t^2}\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
As $t$ approaches infinity, $\der x/\der t$ approaches the speed of light.

<% begin_sec("The momentum four-vector") %>\label{sec:momentum-four-vector}\index{momentum four-vector}\index{four-vector!momentum}
<% begin_sec("Definition for a material particle") %>
If we hope to find something
that plays the role of momentum in relativity, then the
momentum three-vector probably needs to be generalized to some
kind of four-vector. If so, then the law of conservation of momentum will be valid regardless of one's
frame of reference, which is necessary.\footnote{We are not guaranteed that this is the right way to proceed,
since the converse is not true: some three-vectors such as the
electric and magnetic fields are embedded in rank-2 tensors in more complicated ways than this.
See section \ref{sec:e-and-b-not-four-vectors}, p.~\pageref{sec:e-and-b-not-four-vectors}.}

If we are to satisfy the correspondence principle then the relativistic definition of momentum should probably
look as much as possible like the nonrelativistic one.
In subsection \ref{sec:v-four-vector}, we defined the velocity four-vector in the case of
a particle whose $\der x^i$ is not lightlike.
Let's assume for the moment that it makes sense to think of mass as a scalar.
As with Newtonian three-vectors, multiplying a Lorentz scalar by a four-vector vector produces another
quantity that transforms as a four-vector.
We therefore conjecture that the four-momentum of a material particle can be defined
as $p^i=mv^i$, which in Lorentz coordinates is
$(m\gamma,m\gamma v^1,m\gamma v^2,m\gamma v^3)$. There is no \emph{a priori} guarantee that this is right, but it's
the most reasonable thing to guess. It needs to be checked against experiment, and also for consistency with
the other parts of our theory.

The spacelike components look like the classical momentum vector
multiplied by a factor of $\gamma$, the interpretation being that to an observer in this frame, the moving particle's
inertia is increased relative to its value in the particle's rest frame. Such an effect is indeed observed experimentally.
This is why particle accelerators are so big and expensive.
As the particle approaches the speed of light, $\gamma$ diverges, so greater and greater forces are needed in order
to produce the same acceleration. In relativistic scattering processes with material particles,
we find empirically that
the four-momentum we've defined is conserved, which confirms that our conjectures above are valid,
and in particular that the quantity we're calling $m$ can be treated as a Lorentz scalar, and this is
what all physicists do today. The reader is cautioned, however, that up until about 1950, it was common
to use the word ``mass'' for the combination $m\gamma$ (which is what occurs in the Lorentz-coordinate
form of the momentum vector), while referring to $m$ as the ``rest mass.'' This archaic terminology is
only used today in some popular-level books and low-level school textbooks.

<% begin_sec("Equivalence of mass and energy") %>
The momentum four-vector has locked within it the reason for Einstein's famous
$E=mc^2$, which in our relativistic units becomes simply $E=m$. To see why, consider the experimentally measured
inertia of a physical object made out of atoms. The subatomic particles are all moving, and many of the velocities,
e.g., the velocities of the electrons, are quite relativistic. This has the effect of increasing the experimentally
determined inertial mass of the whole object, by a factor of $\gamma$ averaged over all the particles ---
even though the masses of the individual particles are invariant Lorentz scalars.
(This same increase must also be observed for the gravitational mass, based on the equivalence principle
as verified by E\"{o}tv\"{o}s experiments.)

Now if the object is heated, the velocities will increase on the average,
resulting in a further increase in its mass. Thus, a certain amount of heat energy is equivalent to a certain amount
of mass. But if heat energy contributes to mass, then the same must be true for other forms of energy. For example,
suppose that heating leads to a chemical reaction, which converts some heat into electromagnetic binding energy.
If one joule of binding energy did not convert to the same amount of mass as one joule of heat, then this would
allow the object to spontaneously change its own mass, and then by conservation of momentum it would have to
spontaneously change its own velocity, which would clearly violate the principle of relativity. We conclude that
mass and energy are equivalent, both inertially and gravitationally. In relativity, neither is separately conserved;
the conserved quantity is their sum, referred to as the mass-energy, $E$.\index{mass-energy}
An alternative derivation, by Einstein, is given
in example \ref{eg:einstein-mc2} on page \pageref{eg:einstein-mc2}.
<% end_sec %> % Equivalence of mass and energy

<% begin_sec("Energy is the timelike component of the four-momentum") %>
The Lorentz transformation of a zero vector is always zero. This means that the momentum
four-vector of a material object can't equal zero in the object's rest frame, since then
it would be zero in all other frames as well. So for an object of mass $m$, let its
momentum four-vector in its rest frame be $(f(m),0,0,0)$, where $f$ is some function that
we need to determine, and $f$ can depend only on $m$ since there is no other property of
the object that can be dynamically relevant here. Since conservation laws are additive, $f$ has to
be $f(m)=km$ for some universal constant $k$. In where $c=1$, $k$ is unitless.
Since we want to recover the
appropriate Newtonian limit for massive bodies, and since $v_t=1$ in that limit, we need $k=1$.
Transforming the momentum four-vector from the particle's rest frame into some other frame,
we find that the timelike component is no longer $m$. We interpret this as the relativistic mass-energy, $E$.

Since the momentum four-vector was obtained from the magni\-tude-1 velocity four-vector through multiplication by $m$,
its squared magnitude $p^ip_i$ is equal to the square of the particle's mass.
Writing $p$ for the magnitude of the momentum three-vector, and $E$ for the mass-energy, we
find the useful relation $m^2=E^2-p^2$.
We take this to be the relativistic \emph{definition} the mass of any particle, including one
whose $\der x^i$ is lightlike.\index{mass!defined}
<% end_sec %> % Energy is the timelike component of the four-momentum

<% begin_sec("Particles traveling at $c$") %>
The definition of four-momentum as $p^i=mv^i$ only works for particles that move at less than $c$. For those
that move at $c$, the four-velocity is undefined.
As we'll see in example \ref{eg:massless-at-c-proofs} on p.~\pageref{eg:massless-at-c-proofs}, this
class of particles is exactly those that are massless. As shown on p.~\pageref{light-has-momentum-1},
the three-momentum of a light wave is given by $p=E$.\label{light-has-momentum-2}
The fact that this momentum is nonzero implies that for light $p^i=mv^i$ represents an indeterminate form.
The fact that this momentum equals $E$ is consistent with our definition of mass as $m^2=E^2-p^2$.
<% end_sec %> % Particles traveling at $c$

<% begin_sec("Mass is not additive") %>
Since the momentum four-vector $p^a$ is additive, and our definition of mass as
$p^ap_a$ depends on the vector in a nonlinear way, it follows that mass is not additive
(even for particles that are not interacting but are simply considered collectively).
<% end_sec %> % Mass is not additive

\begin{eg}{Mass of two light waves}
Let the momentum of a certain light wave be $(p_t,p_x)=(E,E)$,
and let another such wave have momentum $(E,-E)$. The total momentum is
$(2E,0)$. Thus this pair of massless particles has a collective mass of $2E$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Massless particles travel at $c$}\label{eg:massless-at-c-proofs}\label{c-is-speed-of-massless-particles}
We demonstrate this by showing that if we suppose the opposite, then
there are two different consequences, either of which would be physically unacceptable.

When a particle does have a nonvanishing mass, we have
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{E/m\rightarrow\infty} |v| \quad = \quad  \lim_{E/m\rightarrow\infty} \frac{|p|}{E} \quad = \quad 1\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
Thus if we had
a massless particle with $|v|\ne 1$, its behavior would be different from the limiting behavior of
massive particles. But this is physically unacceptable because then
we would have a magic method for detecting arbitrarily small masses such
as $10^{-10000000000}$ kg. We don't actually know that the photon, for example, is \emph{exactly}
massless; see example \ref{eg:photon-mass} on p.~\pageref{eg:photon-mass}.

Furthermore, suppose that a massless particle had $|v|<1$ in the frame of some observer. Then some
other observer could be at rest relative to the particle. In such a frame,
the particle's three-momentum $\mathbf{p}$ is zero by symmetry, since there is no preferred
direction for it. Then $E^2=p^2+m^2$ is zero as well, so the particle's entire energy-momentum
four-vector is zero. But a four-vector that vanishes in one frame also vanishes in every
other frame. That means we're talking about a particle that can't undergo scattering, emission, or
absorption, and is therefore undetectable by any experiment. This is physically unacceptable because
we don't consider phenomena (e.g., invisible fairies) to be of physical interest if they are
undetectable even in principle.

\begin{eg}{Gravitational redshifts}\label{eg:pound-rebka}
Since a photon's energy $E$ is equivalent to a certain gravitational mass $m$, photons that rise or fall in a gravitational
field must lose or gain energy, and this should be observed as a redshift or blueshift in the frequency.
We expect the change in gravitational potential energy to be $E\Delta \phi$, giving a corresponding opposite change in the photon's
energy, so that $\Delta E/E=\Delta \phi$. In metric units, this becomes $\Delta E/E=\Delta \phi/c^2$, and in the
field near the Earth's surface we have $\Delta E/E=gh/c^2$.
This is the same result that was found in section \ref{subsec:gravitational-redshifts} based only on the equivalence
principle, and verified experimentally by Pound and Rebka as described in section \ref{subsec:pound-rebka}.

\begin{eg}{Constraints on polarization}\label{eg:polzn-constraints}\index{polarization!of light}\index{transverse polarization!of light}
We observe that electromagnetic waves are always polarized transversely, never longitudinally.
Such a constraint can only apply to a wave that propagates at $c$. If it applied to a wave that
propagated at less than $c$, we could move into a frame of reference in which the wave was at rest.
In this frame, all directions in space would be equivalent, and there would be no way to decide which
directions of polarization should be permitted. For a wave that propagates at $c$, there is no frame
in which the wave is at rest (see p.~\pageref{sec:frames-at-c}).
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Relativistic work-energy theorem}
In Einstein's original 1905 paper on relativity, he assumed without providing any justification that
the Newtonian work-energy relation $W=Fd$ was valid relativistically. One way of justifying this is
that we can construct a simple machine with a mechanical advantage $A$ and a reduction of motion by $1/A$,
with these ratios being exact 
relativistically.\footnote{For an explicit example,
see \url{bit.ly/1aUXIa8}.} % http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/78147/4552
One can then calculate, as Einstein did,
\begin{equation*}
  W = \int \frac{\der p}{\der t} \der x = \int \frac{\der p}{\der v}\frac{\der x}{\der t}\der v = m(\gamma-1)\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
which is consistent with our result for $E$ as a function of $\gamma$ if we equate it to $E(\gamma)-E(1)$.

\begin{eg}{The Dirac sea}\label{eg:dirac-sea}\index{Dirac sea}\index{Gell-Mann, Murray}
A great deal of physics can be derived from the T.H.~White's principle that ``whatever is not forbidden in compulsory'' --- originally
intended for ants but applied to particles by Gell-Mann.
In quantum mechanics, any process that is not forbidden by a conservation law is supposed to occur. 
The relativistic relation $E=\pm\sqrt{p^2+m^2}$ has two roots, a
positive one and a negative one.
The positive-energy and negative-energy states are separated by a no-man's land of width $2m$, so no continuous classical
process can lead from one side to the other. But quantum-mechanically,
if an electron exists with energy $E=+\sqrt{p^2+m^2}$, it should be able to make a quantum leap into a state with
$E=-\sqrt{p^2+m^2}$, emitting the energy difference of $2E$ in the form of photons. Why doesn't 
this happen? One explanation is that the states with $E<0$ are all already occupied. This is the ``Dirac sea,'' which
we now interpret as being full of electrons. A vacancy in the sea manifests itself as an antielectron.

\begin{eg}{Massive neutrinos}\label{eg:massive-neutrinos}
Neutrinos were long thought to be massless, but are now believed to have masses in the eV range.
If they had been massless, they would always have had to propagate at the speed of light. Although
they are now thought to have mass, that mass is six orders of magnitude less than the MeV energy scale
of the nuclear reactions in which they are produced, so all neutrinos observed in experiments are
moving at velocities very close to the speed of light.\index{neutrino}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{No radioactive decay of massless particles}\label{eg:photon-decay}
A photon cannot decay into an electron and a positron, $\gamma \rightarrow e^++e^-$,
in the absence of a charged particle to interact with.
To see this, consider the process in the frame of reference
in which the electron-positron pair has zero total momentum. In this frame, the photon must have had zero (three-)momentum,
but a photon with zero momentum must have zero energy as well. This means that conservation of 
relativistic \emph{four}-momentum
has been violated: the timelike component of the four-momentum is the mass-energy, and it has increased
from 0 in the initial state to at least $2mc^2$ in the final state.

To demonstrate the consistency of the theory, we can arrive at the same conclusion by
a different method. Whenever a particle has a small mass (small compared to its energy, say),
it must travel at close to $c$. It must therefore have a very large time dilation, and will
take a very long time to undergo radioactive decay. In the limit as the mass approaches zero,
the time required for the decay approaches infinity. Another way of saying this is that
the rate of radioactive decay must be fixed in terms of proper time, but there is no such
thing as proper time for a massless particle. Thus it is not only this specific process
that is forbidden, but any radioactive decay process involving a massless particle.

There are various loopholes in this argument. The
question is investigated more thoroughly by Fiore and Modanese.\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9508018}}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Massive photons}\index{photon!mass}\label{eg:photon-mass}
Continuing in the same vein as example \ref{eg:massive-neutrinos}, we can consider the possibility that
the photon has some nonvanishing mass. A 2003 experiment by
Luo et al.\footnote{Luo et al., ``New Experimental Limit on the Photon Rest Mass with a Rotating Torsion Balance,'' Phys. Rev. Lett. 90 (2003) 081801.
The interpretation of such experiments is difficult, and this paper attracted a series of comments. A weaker but more universally accepted
bound is $8\times10^{-52}\ \kgunit$, Davis, Goldhaber, and Nieto, Phys. Rev. Lett. 35 (1975) 1402.}
has placed a limit of about $10^{-54}\ \kgunit$ on this mass. This is incredibly small, but
suppose that future experimental work using improved techniques shows that the mass is less than this, but actually nonzero.
A naive reaction to this scenario is that it would shake relativity to its core, since relativity is based
upon the assumption that the speed of light is a constant, whereas for a massive particle it need not be
constant. But this is a misinterpretation of the role of $c$ in relativity. As should be clear
from the approach taken in section \ref{sec:lorentz-geometry}, $c$ is primarily a geometrical property of
spacetime, not a property of light.

In reality, such a discovery would be more of a problem for particle physicists than for relativists, as we can
see by the following sketch of an argument. Imagine two charged particles, at rest, interacting via an electrical attraction.
Quantum mechanics describes this as an exchange of photons. Since the particles are at rest, there is no source of energy,
so where do we get the energy to make the photons? The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, $\Delta E\Delta t \gtrsim h$, allows us to steal this energy,
provided that we give it back within a time $\Delta t$. This time limit imposes a limit on the distance the photons can travel,
but by using photons of low enough energy, we can make this distance limit as large as we like, and there is therefore no
limit on the range of the force. But suppose that the photon has a mass. Then there is
a minimum mass-energy $mc^2$ required in order to create a photon, the maximum time is $h/mc^2$, and the maximum
range is $h/mc$. Refining these crude arguments a little, one finds that exchange of zero-mass particles gives
a force that goes like $1/r^2$, while a nonzero mass results in $e^{-\mu r}/r^2$, where $\mu^{-1}=\hbar/mc$.
For the photon, the best current mass limit corresponds to $\mu^{-1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\ \munit$, so the deviation
from $1/r^2$ would be difficult to measure in earthbound experiments.

Now Gauss's law is a specific characteristic
of $1/r^2$ fields. It would be violated slightly if photons had mass. We would have to modify Maxwell's equations, and
it turns out\footnote{Goldhaber and Nieto, "Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Limits on The Photon Mass," Rev. Mod. Phys. 43 (1971) 277}
that the necessary change to Gauss's law would be of the form $\nabla\cdot \vc{E} = (\ldots) \rho-(\ldots)\mu^2 \Phi$,
where $\Phi$ is the electrical potential, and (\ldots) indicates factors that depend on the choice of units. 
This tells us that $\Phi$, which in classical electromagnetism can only be measured
in terms of differences between different points in space, can now be measured in absolute terms. Gauge symmetry has
been broken. But gauge symmetry is indispensible in creating well-behaved relativistic field theories, and
this is the reason that, in general, particle physicists have a hard time with
forces arising from the exchange of massive particles. The hypothetical Higgs particle, which may be observed at the Large Hadron
Collider in the near future, is essentially a mechanism for wriggling out of this difficulty in the case of the massive W and Z particles
that are responsible for the weak nuclear force; the mechanism cannot, however, be extended to allow a massive photon.

\begin{eg}{Dust and radiation in cosmological models}\label{eg:dust-and-radiation-cosm}\index{dust}
In cosmological models, one needs an equation of state that relates the pressure $P$ to the mass-energy density $\rho$.
The pressure is a Lorentz scalar. The mass-energy density is not (since mass-energy is just the timelike component
of a particular vector), but in a coordinate system without any net flow of mass, we can approximate it as one.

The early universe was dominated by radiation. A photon in a box
contributes a pressure on each wall that is proportional to $|p^\mu|$, where $\mu$ is a spacelike index.
In thermal equilibrium, each of these three degrees of freedom carries an equal amount of energy, and since
momentum and energy are equal for a massless particle, the average momentum along each axis is equal to $\frac{1}{3}E$.
The resulting equation of state is $P=\frac{1}{3}\rho$. As the universe expanded, the wavelengths of the
photons expanded in proportion to the stretching of the space they occupied, resulting in $\lambda \propto a^{-1}$, where
$a$ is a distance scale describing the universe's intrinsic curvature at a fixed time.
Since the number density of photons is diluted in proportion to $a^{-3}$, and the mass per photon varies as $a^{-1}$,
both $\rho$ and $P$ vary as $a^{-4}$.

Cosmologists refer to noninteracting, nonrelativistic materials as ``dust,'' which could mean many things, including
hydrogen gas, actual dust, stars, galaxies, and some forms of dark matter. For dust, the momentum is negligible compared to the mass-energy,
so the equation of state is $P=0$, regardless of $\rho$. The mass-energy density is dominated simply by the mass of
the dust, so there is no red-shift scaling of the $a^{-1}$ type. The mass-energy density scales as $a^{-3}$. Since
this is a less steep dependence on $a$ than the $a^{-4}$, there was a point, about a  thousand years after the Big Bang,
when matter began to dominate over radiation. At this point, the rate of expansion of the universe made a transition to
a qualitatively different behavior resulting from the change in the equation of state.

In the present era, the universe's equation of state is dominated by neither dust nor radiation but by the cosmological
constant (see page \pageref{sec:cosmological-constant}). Figure \figref{equation-of-state} shows the evolution of the
size of the universe for the three different regimes. Some of the simpler cases are derived in sections
\ref{sec:vacuum-dominated} and \ref{sec:matter-dominated}, starting on page \pageref{sec:vacuum-dominated}.

<% begin_sec("The frequency vector and the relativistic Doppler shift") %>\label{sec:doppler}\index{frequency vector}\index{Doppler shift}
The frequency vector was introduced in example \ref{eg:affine-waves} on p.~\pageref{eg:affine-waves}.
In the spirit of index-gymnastics notation,
frequency is to time as the wavenumber\index{wavenumber} $k=1/\lambda$ is to space, so when treating waves relativistically it is
natural to conjecture that there is a four-frequency $f_a$ made by assembling $(f,\vc{k})$, which behaves as a Lorentz vector. This is correct, since
we already know that $\partial_a$ transforms as a covariant vector, and for a scalar wave of the form
$A=A_\zu{o}\exp\left[2\pi i f_ax^a\right]$ the partial derivative operator is identical to multiplication by $2\pi f_a$.

As an application, consider the relativistic Doppler shift of a light wave. For simpicity, let's restrict ourselves to
one spatial dimension.
For a light wave, $f=k$, so the frequency vector in 1+1 dimensions is simply $(f,f)$. Putting this through a Lorentz
transformation, we find
\begin{equation*}
  f' = (1+v)\gamma f = \sqrt{\frac{1+v}{1-v}} f\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where the second form displays more clearly the symmetic form of the relativistic relationship, such that
interchanging the roles of source and observer is equivalent to flipping the sign of $v$. That is, the relativistic
version only depends on the \emph{relative} motion of the source and the observer, whereas the Newtonian one
also depends on the source's motion relative to the medium (i.e., relative to the preferred frame in which the
waves have the ``right'' velocity). In Newtonian mechanics, we have
$f'=(1+v)f$ for a moving observer. Relativistically, there is also a time dilation of the oscillation of the source,
providing an additional factor of $\gamma$.

This analysis is extended to 3+1 dimensions in problem \ref{hw:doppler-three-d}.

\begin{eg}{Ives-Stilwell experiments}\index{Ives-Stilwell experiments}
The relativistic Doppler shift differs from the nonrelativistic one by the time-dilation factor $\gamma$, so that
there is still a shift even when the relative motion of the source and the observer is perpendicular to the direction
of propagation. This is called the transverse Doppler shift. Einstein suggested this early on as a test of relativity.
However, such experiments are difficult to carry out with high precision, because they are sensitive to any error
in the alignment of the 90-degree angle. Such experiments were eventually performed, with results that confirmed
relativity,\footnote{See, e.g., Hasselkamp, Mondry, and Scharmann, Zeitschrift f\"ur Physik A: Hadrons and Nuclei 289 (1979) 151.}
but one-dimensional measurements provided both the earliest tests of the relativistic Doppler shift and the most precise
ones to date. The first such test was done by Ives and Stilwell in 1938, using the following trick. The relativistic
expression $S_v = \sqrt{(1+v)/(1-v)}$ for the Doppler shift has the property that $S_vS_{-v}=1$, which differs from the
nonrelativistic result of $(1+v)(1-v)=1-v^2$. One can therefore accelerate an ion up to a relativistic speed, measure
both the forward Doppler shifted frequency $f_f$ and the backward one  $f_b$, and compute $\sqrt{f_ff_b}$. According
to relativity, this should exactly equal the frequency $f_\zu{o}$ measured in the ion's rest frame.

In a particularly exquisite modern version of the Ives-Stilwell idea,\footnote{G.~Saathoff et al., ``Improved Test
of Time Dilation in Relativity,'' Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 (2003) 190403. A publicly available description of the
experiment is given in Saathoff's PhD thesis, \url{www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/ato/homes/saathoff/diss-saathoff.pdf}.} 
Saathoff et al.~circulated $\zu{Li}^+$ ions at $v=.064$ in a storage ring. An electron-cooler technique was
used in order to reduce the variation in velocity among ions in the beam. Since the identity $S_vS_{-v}=1$
is independent of $v$, it was not necessary to measure $v$ to the same incredible precision as the frequencies;
it was only necessary that it be stable and well-defined. The natural line width was 7 MHz, and other experimental
effects broadened it further to 11 MHz. By curve-fitting the line, it was possible to achieve results good to
a few tenths of a MHz. The resulting frequencies, in units of MHz, were:

\begin{tabular}{rl}
$f_f$ & =          $582490203.44 \pm .09$ \\
$f_b$ & =          $512671442.9  \pm 0.5$ \\
$\sqrt{f_ff_b}$ &= $546466918.6  \pm 0.3$ \\
$f_\zu{o}$ &=      $546466918.8  \pm 0.4$ (from previous experimental work) 
\end{tabular}

\noindent The spectacular agreement with theory has made this experiment a lightning rod for
anti-relativity kooks.

If one is searching for small deviations from the predictions of special relativity, a natural place to look
is at high velocities. Ives-Stilwell experiments have been performed at velocities as high as $0.84$, and
they confirm special relativity.\footnote{MacArthur et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 56 (1986) 282 (1986)}

\begin{eg}{Einstein's derivation of $E=mc^2$}\label{eg:einstein-mc2}
On page \pageref{sec:momentum-four-vector}, we showed that the celebrated $E=mc^2$ follows directly from
the form of the Lorentz transformation. An alternative derivation was given by Einstein in one of his
classic 1905 papers laying out the theory of special relativity; the paper is short, and is reproduced 
in English translation on page \pageref{einstein-paper-mc2} of this book. Having laid the groundwork
of four-vectors and relativistic Doppler shifts, we can give an even shorter version of Einstein's
argument. The discussion is also streamlined by restricting the discussion to 1+1 dimensions and by
invoking photons.

Suppose that a lantern, at rest in the lab frame, is floating weightlessly in outer space, and
simultaneously emits two pulses of light in opposite directions, each with energy $E/2$ and frequency $f$.
By symmetry, the momentum of the pulses cancels, and the lantern remains at rest. An observer in motion at
velocity $v$ relative to the lab sees the frequencies of the beams shifted to $f'=(1\pm v)\gamma f$.
The effect on the energies of the beams can be found purely classically, by transforming the electric and magnetic fields
to the moving frame, but as a shortcut we can apply the quantum-mechanical relation $E_{ph}=hf$ for the energies
of the photons making up the beams. The result is that the moving observer finds the total energy of the beams to be
not $E$ but $(E/2)(1+v)\gamma +(E/2)(1-v)\gamma=E\gamma$.

Both observers agree that the lantern had to use up some
of the energy stored in its fuel in order to make the two pulses. But the moving observer says that in addition to this
energy $E$, there was a further energy $E(\gamma-1)$. Where could this energy have come from? It must have come from
the kinetic energy of the lantern. The lantern's velocity remained constant throughout the
experiment, so this decrease in kinetic energy seen by the moving observer 
must have come from a decrease in the lantern's inertial mass --- hence the title of Einstein's paper,
``Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content?''

To figure out how much mass the lantern has lost, we have to decide how we can even define mass in this new
context. In Newtonian mechanics, we had $K=(1/2)mv^2$, and by the correspondence principle this must still
hold in the low-velocity limit. Expanding $E(\gamma-1)$ in a Taylor series, we find that it
equals $E(v^2/2)+\ldots$, and in the low-velocity limit this must be the same as $\Delta K=(1/2)\Delta m v^2$,
so $\Delta m=E$. Reinserting factors of $c$ to get back to nonrelativistic units, we have
$E=\Delta m c^2$.

<% begin_sec("A non-example: electric and magnetic fields") %>\label{sec:e-and-b-not-four-vectors}
It is fairly easy to see that the electric and magnetic fields cannot be the spacelike parts of two four-vectors.
Consider the arrangement shown in figure \subfigref{b-field}{1}. We have
two infinite trains of moving charges superimposed on the same line, and a single charge alongside the line.
Even though the line charges formed by the two trains
are moving in opposite directions, their currents don't cancel. A negative charge moving
to the left makes a current that goes to the right, so in frame 1,
the total current is twice that contributed by either line charge.

In frame 1 the charge densities of the two line charges cancel out,
and the electric field experienced by the lone charge is therefore zero.
Frame 2 shows what we'd see if we were observing all this from a frame of reference moving
along with the lone charge.
Both line charges are in motion in both frames of reference, but in frame 1, the
line charges were moving at equal speeds, so their Lorentz contractions were equal, and their
charge densities canceled out. In frame 2, however, their speeds are unequal. The positive
charges are moving more slowly than in frame 1, so in frame 2 they are less contracted.
The negative charges are moving more quickly, so their contraction is greater now.
Since the charge densities don't cancel, there is an electric field in frame 2, which
points into the wire, attracting the lone charge. 
<% marg(60) %>
<%
  fig(
    'b-field',
    %q{Magnetism is a purely relativistic effect.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

We appear to have a logical contradiction here, because an observer in frame 2 predicts that
the charge will collide with the wire, whereas in frame 1 it looks as though it should
move with constant velocity parallel to the wire.
Experiments show that the charge does collide with the wire, so to maintain the Lorentz-invariance
of electromagnetism, we are forced to invent a new kind of interaction, one between moving
charges and other moving charges, which causes the acceleration in frame 2. This
is the magnetic interaction, and if we hadn't known about it already, we would have been forced
to invent it. That is, magnetism is a purely relativistic effect. The reason a relativistic effect
can be strong enough to stick a magnet to a refrigerator is that it breaks the delicate cancellation
of the extremely large electrical interactions between electrically neutral objects.

Although the example shows that the electric and magnetic fields do transform when we change
from one frame to another, it is easy to show that they do not transform as the spacelike
parts of a relativistic four-vector.
This is because transformation between frames 1 and 2 is along the axis parallel to the wire, but it affects the components of the fields perpendicular to the wire.
The electromagnetic field actually transforms as a rank-2 tensor.


<% end_sec %> % A non-example: electric and magnetic fields

<% begin_sec("The electromagnetic potential four-vector",nil,'em-four-vector') %>\index{electromagnetic potential four-vector}
An electromagnetic quantity that \emph{does} transform as a four-vector is the potential.
On page \pageref{em-gauge-first-mentioned}, I mentioned the fact, which may or may not already be familiar to you,
that whereas the Newtonian gravitational field's polarization properties allow it to be described using a single
scalar potential $\phi$ or a single vector field $\vc{g}=-\nabla\phi$, the pair of electromagnetic fields
$(\vc{E},\vc{B})$ needs a pair of potentials, $\Phi$ and $\vc{A}$. It's easy to see that $\Phi$ can't be a Lorentz scalar.
Electric charge $q$ is a scalar, so if $\Phi$ were a scalar as well, then the product $q\Phi$ would be a scalar.
But this is equal to the energy of the charged particle, which is only the timelike component of the energy-momentum
four-vector, and therefore not a Lorentz scaler itself. This is a contradiction, so $\Phi$ is not a scalar.

To see how to fit $\Phi$ into relativity, consider the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical relation $q\Phi=hf$ for a charged particle
in a potential $\Phi$. Since $f$ is the timelike component of a four-vector in relativity, we need $\Phi$ to be the timelike
component of some four vector, $A_b$. For the spacelike part of this four-vector, let's write $\vc{A}$, so that $A_b=(\Phi,\vc{A})$.
We can see by the following argument that this mysterious $\vc{A}$ must have something to do with the magnetic field.

Consider the example of figure \figref{least-action} from a quantum-mechanical point of view. The charged particle $q$ has wave properties,
but let's say that it can be well approximated in this example as following a specific trajectory. This is like the ray
approximation to wave optics. A light ray in classical optics follows Fermat's principle,\index{Fermat's principle} also known as the principle
of least time, which states that the ray's path from point A to point B is one that extremizes the optical path length (essentially the number of
oscillations).
The reason for this is that the ray approximation is only an approximation. The ray actually has some width, which we
can visualize as a bundle of neighboring trajectories. Only if the trajectory follows Fermat's principle will the
interference among the neighboring paths be constructive. The classical optical path length is found by integrating
$\vc{k}\cdot\der\vc{s}$, where $\vc{k}$ is the wavenumber. To make this relativistic, we need to use the frequency
four-vector to form $f_b\der x^b$, which can also be expressed as
$f_b v^b \der \tau=\gamma(f-\vc{k}\cdot\vc{v})\der\tau$. If the charge is at rest and there are no magnetic fields, then the quantity in parentheses
is $f=E/h=(q/h)\Phi$. The correct relativistic generalization is clearly $f_b=(q/h)A_b$.\label{vector-potential-propagator}

Since $A_b$'s spacelike part, $\vc{A}$, results\label{potential-to-fields}
in the velocity-dependent effects, we conclude that $\vc{A}$ is a kind of potential that relates to the magnetic field, in the same
way that the potential $\Phi$ relates to the electric field. $\vc{A}$ is known as the vector potential, and the
relation between the potentials and the fields is
\begin{align*}
  \vc{E} &= -\nabla\Phi - \frac{\partial\vc{A}}{\partial t} \\
  \vc{B} &= \nabla\vc{A}\eqquad.
\end{align*}
An excellent discussion of the vector potential from a purely classical point of view
is given in the classic \emph{Feynman Lectures}.\footnote{\emph{The Feynman Lectures on Physics}, Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, Addison Wesley Longman, 1970}

<% begin_sec("The tensor transformation laws") %>\label{sec:tensor-transformation-law}\index{transformation laws}\index{tensor transformation laws}
We may wish to represent a vector in more than one coordinate system, and to convert back
and forth between the two representations. In general relativity, the transformation of
the coordinates need not be linear, as in the Lorentz transformations; it can be any smooth,
one-to-one function.
For simplicity, however, we start by considering the one-dimensional case, and by assuming the
coordinates are related in an affine manner, $x'^\mu=ax^\mu+b$.
The addition of the constant $b$ is merely a change in the choice of origin, so it has
no effect on the components of the vector, but the dilation by the factor $a$
gives a change in scale, which results in $v'^\mu = a v^\mu$ for a contravariant vector.
In the special case where $v$ is an infinitesimal displacement, this is consistent
with the result found by implicit differentiation of the coordinate transformation.
For a contravariant vector, $v'_\mu = \frac{1}{a} v_\mu$. Generalizing to more than one
dimension, and to a possibly nonlinear transformation, we have
\begin{align}
  v'^\mu &=  v^\kappa \frac{\partial x'^\mu}{\partial x^\kappa} \\
  v'_\mu &=  v_\kappa \frac{\partial x^\kappa}{\partial x'^\mu}\eqquad.
\end{align}
Note the inversion of the partial derivative in one equation compared to the other.
Because these equations describe a change from one coordinate system to another,
they clearly depend on the coordinate system, so we use Greek indices rather than
the Latin ones that would indicate a coordinate-independent equation. Note that
the letter $\mu$ in these equations always appears as an index referring to the
new coordinates, $\kappa$ to the old ones. For this reason, we can get away with
dropping the primes and writing, e.g., $v^\mu=v^\kappa \partial x'^\mu/\partial x^\kappa$
rather than $v'$, counting on context to show that $v^\mu$ is the vector expressed in the
new coordinates, $v^\kappa$ in the old ones. This becomes especially natural if we start
working in a specific coordinate system where the coordinates have names. For example,
if we transform from coordinates $(t,x,y,z)$ to $(a,b,c,d)$, then it is clear that
$v^t$ is expressed in one system and $v^c$ in the other.

Self-check: Recall that the gauge transformations allowed in general relativity are not just any
coordinate transformations; they must be (1) smooth and (2) one-to-one. Relate both of these
requirements to the features of the vector transformation laws above.

In equation [2], $\mu$ appears as a subscript on the left side of the
equation, but as a superscript on the right. This would appear to violate our rules of
notation, but the interpretation here is that in expressions of the form $\partial/\partial x^i$
and $\partial/\partial x_i$, the superscripts and subscripts should be understood as being
turned upside-down. Similarly, [1] appears to have the implied sum over $\kappa$
written ungrammatically, with both $\kappa$'s appearing as superscripts.
Normally we only have implied sums in which the index appears once as a superscript and once
as a subscript. With our new rule for interpreting indices on the bottom of derivatives,
the implied sum is seen to be written correctly. This rule is similar to the one for
analyzing the units of derivatives written in Leibniz notation, with, e.g., $\der^2 x/\der t^2$ having
units of meters per second squared.\label{derivative-flip-indices}
That is, the flipping of the indices like this is required for  consistency so that
everything will work out properly when we change our units of measurement, causing all our
vector components to be rescaled.

A quantity $v$ that transforms according to [1] or [2]
is referred to as a rank-1 tensor,\index{tensor}\index{tensor!transformation law}
which is the same thing as a vector.

\begin{eg}{The identity transformation}
In the case of the identity transformation $x'^\mu=x^\mu$, equation [1] clearly gives $v'=v$,
since all the mixed partial derivatives $\partial x'^\mu/\partial x^\kappa$ with $\mu \ne \kappa$ are
zero, and all the derivatives for $\kappa=\mu$ equal 1.

In equation [2], it is tempting to write
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{\partial x^\kappa}{\partial x'^\mu} = \frac{1}{\frac{\partial x'^\mu}{\partial x^\kappa}} \qquad \text{(wrong!)}\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
but this would give infinite results for the mixed terms! Only in the case of functions of a single
variable is it possible to flip derivatives in this way; it doesn't work for partial derivatives.
To evaluate these partial derivatives, we have to invert the transformation (which in this example
is trivial to accomplish) and then take the partial derivatives.
\end{eg}

The metric is a rank-2 tensor, and transforms analogously:
\begin{equation*}
  g_{\mu\nu} = g_{\kappa\lambda} \frac{\partial x^\kappa}{\partial x'^\mu} \frac{\partial x^\lambda}{\partial x'^\nu}
\end{equation*}
(writing $g$ rather than $g'$ on the left, because context makes the distinction clear).

Self-check: Write the similar expressions for $g^{\mu\nu}$, $g^\mu_\nu$, and $g_\mu^\nu$, which are
entirely determined by the grammatical rules for writing superscripts and subscripts. Interpret the case
of a rank-0 tensor.

\begin{eg}{An accelerated coordinate system?}\label{eg:bogus-accel-metric}
Let's see the effect on Lorentzian metric $g$ of the transformation
\begin{equation*}
  t' = t   \qquad
  x' = x+\frac{1}{2}at^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The inverse transformation is
\begin{equation*}
  t = t'   \qquad
  x = x'-\frac{1}{2}at'^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
The tensor transformation law gives
\begin{align*}
  g'_{t't'} &= 1-(at')^2 \\
  g'_{x'x'} &= -1 \\
  g'_{x't'} &= -at'\eqquad.
\end{align*}
Clearly something bad happens at $at'=\pm1$, when the relative velocity surpasses the
speed of light: the $t't'$ component of the metric vanishes and then reverses its sign.
This would be physically unreasonable if we viewed this as a transformation from observer A's
Lorentzian frame into the
accelerating reference frame of observer B aboard a spaceship who feels a constant
acceleration. Several things prevent such an interpretation: (1) B cannot exceed the speed
of light. (2) Even before B gets to the speed of light, the coordinate $t'$ cannot correspond to B's proper time, which is dilated.
(3) Due to time dilation, A and B do not agree on the rate at which B is accelerating.
If B measures her own acceleration to be $a'$, A will judge it to be $a<a'$, with
$a\rightarrow0$ as B approaches the speed of light. There is nothing invalid
about the coordinate system $(t',x')$, but neither does it have any physically interesting
interpretation.

\begin{eg}{Physically meaningful constant acceleration}\label{eg:const-accel-metric}
To make a more physically meaningful version of example \ref{eg:bogus-accel-metric},
we need to use the result of example \ref{eg:hyperbolic-motion} on page \pageref{eg:hyperbolic-motion}.
The somewhat messy derivation of the coordinate transformation is given by Semay.\footnote{\url{arxiv.org/abs/physics/0601179}}
The result is
\begin{align*}
  t' &= \left(x+\frac{1}{a}\right) \sinh at \\
  x' &= \left(x+\frac{1}{a}\right) \cosh at 
\end{align*}
Applying the tensor transformation law gives (problem \ref{hw:const-accel-metric}, page \pageref{hw:const-accel-metric}):
\begin{align*}
  g'_{t't'} &= (1+ax')^2 \\
  g'_{x'x'} &= -1
\end{align*}
Unlike the result of example \ref{eg:bogus-accel-metric}, this one never misbehaves.

The relation between the potential $\vc{A}$ and the fields $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$ given on page \pageref{potential-to-fields}
can be written in manifestly covariant form as $F_{ij}=\partial_{[i} A_{j]}$, where $F$, called the electromagnetic tensor,\index{electromagnetic tensor}
is an antisymmetric rank-two tensor whose six independent components correspond in a certain way with the components of the $\vc{E}$ and $\vc{B}$
three-vectors. If $F$ vanishes completely at a certain point in spacetime, then the linear form of the tensor transformation laws guarantees
that it will vanish in all coordinate systems, not just one. The GPS system\index{GPS!timing signals} takes advantage of this fact
in the transmission of timing signals from the satellites to the users. The electromagnetic wave is modulated so that the bits
it transmits are represented by phase reversals of the wave. At these phase reversals, $F$ vanishes, and this vanishing holds true
regardless of the motion of the user's unit or its position in the earth's gravitational field.

\begin{eg}{Momentum wants a lower index}\label{eg:momentum-is-lower-index}
In example \ref{eg:force-is-lower-index} on p.~\pageref{eg:force-is-lower-index}, we saw that
once we arbitrarily chose to write ruler measurements in Euclidean three-space
as $\Delta x^a$ rather than $\Delta x_a$, it became
natural to think of the Newtonian force three-vector as ``wanting'' to be notated with
a lower index.
We can do something similar with the momentum 3- or 4-vector. The Lagrangian is a relativistic
scalar, and in Lagrangian mechanics momentum is defined by
$p_a = \partial L/\partial v^a$.
The upper index in the denominator on the right becomes a lower index on the left by the same reasoning
as was employed in the notation of the tensor transformation laws. Newton's second law shows that this is
consistent with the result of example \ref{eg:force-is-lower-index} on p.~\pageref{eg:force-is-lower-index}.

The techniques developed in this chapter allow us to make a variety of new predictions that can be
tested by experiment.
In general, the mathematical treatment of all observables in relativity as tensors means that
all observables must obey the same transformation laws.
This is an extremely strict statement, because it requires that a wide variety of physical systems
show identical behavior. For example, we already mentioned on page \pageref{types-of-gyroscopes} the
2007 Gravity Probe B\index{Gravity Probe B} experiment (discussed in detail on pages
\pageref{sec:geodetic-effect-estimate} and \pageref{sec:geodetic-effect-exact}), in which
four gyroscopes aboard a satellite were observed to precess due to special- and general-relativistic
effects. The gyroscopes were complicated electromechanical systems, but the predicted precession
was entirely independent of these complications. We argued that if two different types of
gyroscopes displayed different behaviors, then the resulting discrepancy would allow us to
map out some mysterious vector field. This field would be a built-in characteristic of spacetime
(not produced by any physical objects nearby), and since all observables in general relativity are
supposed to be tensors, the field would have to transform as a tensor. Let's say that this tensor
was of rank 1. Since the tensor transformation law is linear, a nonzero tensor can never be
transformed into a vanishing tensor in another coordinate system. But by the equivalence principle,
any special, local property of spacetime can be made to vanish by transforming into a free-falling
frame of reference, in which the spacetime is has a generic Lorentzian geometry. The mysterious
new field should therefore vanish in such a frame. This is a contradiction, so we conclude that
different types of gyroscopes cannot differ in their behavior.

This is an example of a new way of stating the equivalence principle: there is no way to associate
a preferred tensor field with spacetime.\footnote{This statement of the equivalence principle, along with
the others we have encountered, is summarized in the back of the book on page
\pageref{equivalence-principle-summary}.}\label{equivalence-no-preferred-field}\index{equivalence principle!no preferred field}

In a Lorentz invariant theory, we interpret $c$ as a property of the underlying spacetime, not
of the particles that inhabit it. One way in which Lorentz invariance could be violated would
be if different types of particles had different maximum velocities. In 1997, Coleman and Glashow

Assuming Lorentz invariance, a photon cannot decay into an electron and a positron, $\gamma \rightarrow e^++e^-$
(example \ref{eg:photon-decay}, page \pageref{eg:photon-decay}). Suppose, however, that material particles have
a maximum speed $c_m=1$, while photons have a maximum speed $c_p>1$. Then the photon's momentum four-vector,
$(E,E/c_p)$ is timelike, so a frame does exist in which its three-momentum is zero. The detection of cosmic-ray
gammas from distant sources with energies on the order of 10 TeV puts an upper limit on the decay rate,
implying $c_p-1 \lesssim 10^{-15}$.

An even more stringent limit can be put on the possibility of $c_p<1$. When a charged particle moves through a medium
at a speed higher than the speed of light in the medium, Cerenkov radiation\index{Cerenkov radiation}
results. If $c_p$ is less than 1, then Cerenkov radiation could be emitted by high-energy charged particles
in a vacuum, and the particles would rapidly lose energy. The observation of cosmic-ray protons with energies $\sim 10^8$ TeV
requires $c_p-1 \gtrsim -10^{-23}$.

The straightforward properties of the momentum four-vector have surprisingly far-reaching
implications for matter subject to extreme pressure, as in a star that uses up all its fuel
for nuclear fusion and collapses. These implications were initially considered too exotic to
be taken seriously by astronomers. For historical perspective, consider that in 1916, when Einstein
published the theory of general relativity, the Milky Way was believed to constitute the entire universe; the ``spiral nebulae''
were believed to be inside it, rather than being similar objects exterior to it. The only types of stars whose
structure was understood even vaguely were those that were roughly analogous to our own sun. (It was not known that
nuclear fusion was their source of energy.) The term ``white dwarf'' had not been invented, and neutron stars were
unknown.

An ordinary, smallish star such as our own sun has enough hydrogen to sustain fusion reactions for billions of
years, maintaining an equilibrium between its gravity and the pressure of its gases.
When the hydrogen is used up, it has to begin fusing heavier elements. This leads to a period of
relatively rapid fluctuations in structure. Nuclear fusion proceeds up until the formation of elements as heavy as
oxygen ($Z=8$), but the temperatures are not high enough to overcome the strong electrical repulsion of
these nuclei to create even heavier ones.  Some matter is blown off, but finally nuclear reactions cease
and the star collapses under the pull of its own gravity.

To understand what happens in such a collapse, we have to understand the behavior 
of gases under very high pressures.
In general, a surface area $A$ within a gas is subject to collisions in a time $t$ from the $n$ particles occupying
the volume $V=Avt$, where $v$ is the typical velocity of the particles. The resulting pressure is given by $P\sim npv/V$,
where $p$ is the typical momentum.

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \emph{Nondegenerate gas:} In an ordinary gas such as air, the particles are nonrelativistic, so $v=p/m$, and the thermal energy per particle
  is $p^2/2m\sim kT$, so the pressure is $P\sim nkT/V$.
\item[] \emph{Nonrelativistic, degenerate gas:} When a fermionic gas is subject to extreme pressure, the dominant effects creating pressure are
  quantum-mechanical. Because of the Pauli exclusion
  principle, the volume available to each particle is $\sim V/n$, so its wavelength is no more than $\sim(V/n)^{1/3}$, leading to
  $p=h/\lambda \sim h(n/V)^{1/3}$. If the speeds of the particles are still nonrelativistic, then $v=p/m$ still holds, so
  the pressure becomes $P \sim (h^2/m)(n/V)^{5/3}$.
\item[] \emph{Relativistic, degenerate gas:} If the compression is strong enough to cause highly relativistic motion for the particles, then
  $v \approx c$, and the result is $P\sim hc(n/V)^{4/3}$.
\end{itemize}

As a star with the mass of our sun collapses, it reaches a point at which the electrons begin to behave as a degenerate gas, and
the collapse stops. The resulting object is called a white dwarf.\index{white dwarf}
A white dwarf should be an extremely compact body, about the size of the Earth. Because of its small surface area, it should
emit very little light. In 1910, before the theoretical predictions had been made, Russell, Pickering, and Fleming
discovered that 40 Eridani B had these characteristics. Russell recalled:
``I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once that there was an extreme inconsistency between what
we would then have called `possible' values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not
only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but
Pickering smiled upon me, and said: `It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge,' and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study!''

S. Chandrasekhar showed in that 1930's that there
was an upper limit to the mass of a white dwarf. We will recapitulate his calculation briefly in condensed order-of-magnitude form.
The pressure at the core of the star is $P\sim \rho g r\sim GM^2/r^4$, where $M$
is the total mass of the star. The star contains roughly equal numbers of neutrons, protons, and electrons, so $M=Knm$, where $m$ is
the mass of the electron, $n$ is the number of electrons, and $K\approx 4000$.  For stars near the limit, the electrons are relativistic.
Setting the pressure at the core equal to the degeneracy pressure of a relativistic gas, we find that the
Chandrasekhar limit\index{Chandrasekhar limit}\label{chandrasekhar-limit}
is $\sim (hc/G)^{3/2}(Km)^{-2}=6M_\odot$. A less sloppy calculation gives something more like $1.4M_\odot$.
The self-consistency of this solution is investigated in homework problem \ref{hw:white-dwarf} on page \pageref{hw:white-dwarf}.

What happens to a star whose mass is above the Chandrasekhar limit? As nuclear fusion reactions flicker out,
the core of the star becomes a white dwarf, but once fusion ceases completely this cannot be an equilibrium
state. Now consider the nuclear reactions\index{neutron star}
\begin{align*}
  \zu{n} & \rightarrow \zu{p} + e^- + \bar{\nu} \\
  \zu{p} & + e^-  \rightarrow \zu{n} + \nu\eqquad,
\end{align*}
which happen due to the weak nuclear force. The first of these releases 0.8 MeV, and has a half-life of 14 minutes.
This explains why free neutrons are not observed in significant numbers in our universe, e.g., in cosmic rays.
The second reaction requires an \emph{input} of 0.8 MeV of energy, so a free hydrogen atom is stable.
The white dwarf contains fairly heavy nuclei, not individual protons, but similar considerations would seem to apply.
A nucleus can absorb an electron and convert a proton into a neutron, and in this context the process is
called electron capture.\index{electron capture}
Ordinarily this process will only occur if the nucleus is neutron-deficient; once it reaches a neutron-to-proton ratio that
optimizes its binding energy, neutron capture cannot proceed without a source of energy to make the reaction go.
In the environment of a white dwarf, however, there is such a source. The annihilation of an electron opens up a
hole in the ``Fermi sea.'' There is now an state into which another electron is allowed to drop without violating the
exclusion principle, and the effect cascades upward. In a star with a mass above the Chandrasekhar limit, this process
runs to completion, with every proton being converted into a neutron. The result is a \emph{neutron star},\index{neutron star}
which is essentially an atomic nucleus (with $Z=0$) with the mass of a star!

Observational evidence for the existence of neutron stars came in 1967 with the detection by Bell and Hewish at Cambridge
of a mysterious  radio signal with a period of 1.3373011 seconds. The signal's observability
was synchronized with the rotation of the earth relative to the stars, rather than with legal clock time
or the earth's rotation relative to the sun. This led to the conclusion that its origin was in space rather than
on earth, and Bell and Hewish originally dubbed it LGM-1 for ``little green men.'' The discovery of a second signal,
from a different direction in the sky, convinced them that it was not actually an artificial signal being generated
by aliens. Bell published the observation as an appendix to her PhD thesis, and it was soon interpreted as
a signal from a neutron star. Neutron stars can be highly magnetized, and because of this magnetization they
may emit a directional beam of electromagnetic radiation that sweeps across the sky once per rotational period ---
the ``lighthouse effect.'' If the earth lies in the plane of the beam, a periodic signal can be detected, and
the star is referred to as a pulsar.\index{pulsar} It is fairly easy to see that the short period of rotation
makes it difficult to explain a pulsar as any kind of less exotic rotating object. In the approximation of
Newtonian mechanics, a spherical body of density $\rho$, rotating with a period $T=\sqrt{3\pi/G\rho}$, has zero
apparent gravity at its equator, since gravity is just strong enough to accelerate an object so that it
follows a circular trajectory above a fixed point on the surface (problem \ref{hw:pulsar}).\label{pulsar-density}
In reality, astronomical bodies of planetary size and greater are held together by their own gravity, so we have
$T \gtrsim 1/\sqrt{G\rho}$ for any body that does not fly apart spontaneously due to its own rotation.
In the case of the Bell-Hewish pulsar, this implies $\rho \gtrsim 10^{10}\ \kgunit/\munit^3$, which is
far larger than the density of normal matter, and also 10-100 times greater than the typical density of
a white dwarf near the Chandrasekhar limit.

An upper limit on the mass of a neutron star can be found in a manner entirely analogous to the
calculation of the Chandrasekhar limit. The only difference is that the mass of a neutron is much
greater than the mass of an electron, and the neutrons are the only particles present, so there is
no factor of $K$. Assuming the more precise result of $1.4M_\odot$ for the Chandrasekhar limit rather than our
sloppy one, and ignoring the interaction of the neutrons via the strong nuclear force,
we can infer an upper limit on the mass of a neutron star:
\begin{equation*}
  1.4M_\odot\left(\frac{Km_e}{m_n}\right)^2 \approx 5M_\odot
\end{equation*}
The theoretical uncertainties in such an estimate are fairly large.
Tolman, Oppenheimer, and Volkoff\index{Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit}\label{tolman-oppenheimer-volkoff-limit}
originally estimated it in 1939 as $0.7M_\odot$, whereas modern estimates are more in the range of 1.5
to $3M_\odot$. These are significantly lower than our crude estimate of $5M_\odot$,
mainly because the attractive nature of the strong nuclear force tends to pull the star toward
collapse. Unambiguous results are presently impossible because of uncertainties in extrapolating the
behavior of the strong force from the regime of ordinary nuclei, where it has been relatively well parametrized, into
the exotic environment of a neutron star, where the density is significantly different and no protons
are present. There are a variety of effects that may be difficult to anticipate or to calculate. For example,
Brown and Bethe found in 1994\index{Brown-Bethe scenario}\footnote{H.A. Bethe and G.E. Brown, ``Observational constraints on the maximum neutron star mass,''
Astrophys. J. 445 (1995) L129.  G.E. Brown and H.A. Bethe, ``A Scenario for a Large Number of Low-Mass Black Holes in the Galaxy,''
Astrophys. J.  423 (1994) 659. Both papers are available at \url{adsabs.harvard.edu}.} that it might be possible for the mass limit to be drastically revised because
of the process $e^-\rightarrow K^-+\nu_e$, which is impossible in free space due to conservation of energy, but
might be possible in a neutron star. Observationally, nearly all neutron stars seem to lie in a surprisingly
small range of mass, between 1.3 and $1.45M_\odot$, but in 2010 a neutron star with a mass of $1.97\pm .04\ M_\odot$ was discovered,
ruling out most neutron-star models that included exotic matter.\footnote{Demorest
et al., \url{arxiv.org/abs/1010.5788v1}.}

For stars with masses above the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, theoretical predictions become even more speculative.
A variety of bizarre objects has been proposed, including black stars, gravastars, quark stars, boson stars, Q-balls, and electroweak stars.
It seems likely, however, both on theoretical and observational grounds, that objects with masses of about 3 to 20
solar masses end up as black holes; see section \ref{sec:black-hole-formation}.\index{black hole!formation}

<% begin_sec("No general conservation laws") %>\label{sec:no-conservation-laws}
Some of the first tensors we discussed were mass and charge, both rank-0 tensors, and the rank-1 momentum tensor, which
contains both the classical energy and the classical momentum. Physicists originally decided that
mass, charge, energy, and momentum were interesting because these things were found to be conserved. This makes it natural
to ask how conservation laws can be formulated in relativity. We're used to stating conservation laws
casually in terms of the amount of something in the whole universe, e.g., that classically the total amount of
mass in the universe stays constant. Relativity does allow us to make physical models of the universe
as a whole, so it seems as though we ought to be able to talk about conservation laws
in relativity.

We can't.

First, how do we define ``stays constant?'' Simultaneity isn't well-defined, so we can't just
take two snapshots, call them initial and final, and compare the total amount of, say, electric charge
in each snapshot. This difficulty isn't insurmountable. As in figure \figref{conservation-spacelike-surfaces}, we can arbitrarily pick out three-dimensional
spacelike surfaces --- one initial and one final --- and integrate the charge over each one. A law
of conservation of charge would say that no matter what spacelike surface we picked, the total
charge on each would be the same.


Next there's the issue that the integral might diverge, especially if the universe was spatially
infinite. For now, let's assume a spatially finite universe. For simplicity, let's assume that
it has the topology of a three-sphere (see section \ref{sec:cosmological-solutions}
for reassurance that this isn't physically unreasonable), and we can visualize it as a two-sphere.

In the case of the momentum four-vector, what coordinate system would we express it in? In general,
we do not even expect to be able to define a smooth, well-behaved coordinate system that covers the
entire universe, and even if we did, it would not make sense to add a vector expressed in that
coordinate system at point A to another vector from point B; the best we could do would be
to parallel-transport the vectors to one point and then add them, but parallel transport is
path-dependent. (Similar issues occur with angular momentum.)
For this reason, let's restrict ourselves to the easier case of a scalar, such as
electric charge.

But now we're in real trouble. How would we go about actually measuring the total electric charge of
the universe? The only way to do it is to measure electric fields, and then apply Gauss's law.
This requires us to single out some surface that we can integrate the flux over, as in \figref{conservation-sphere-belly-button}. This would really
be a two-dimensional surface on the three-sphere, but we can visualize it as a one-dimensional
surface --- a closed curve --- on the two-sphere. But now suppose this curve is a great circle, \figref{conservation-sphere-equator}. If we
measure a nonvanishing total flux across it, how do we know where the charge is? It could be
on either side.

The conclusion is that conservation laws only make sense in relativity under very special
circumstances.\footnote{For another argument leading to the same conclusion, see subsection \ref{sec:ctc}, p.~\pageref{sec:ctc}.} We do not have anything like over-arching, global
principles of conservation.
As an example of the appropriate special circumstances, section \ref{sec:sch-conserved}, p.~\pageref{sec:sch-conserved} shows how to define conserved quantities, which
behave like energy and momentum, for the
motion of a test particle in a particular metric that has a certain symmetry. This is generalized 
on p.~\pageref{sec:killing-conservation} to a general, global conservation law corresponding to every
continuous symmetry of a spacetime.
<% end_sec %> % No general conservation laws
<% begin_sec("Conservation of angular momentum and frame dragging") %>\label{sec:frame-dragging}
Another special case where conservation laws work is that if the spacetime we're studying gets very flat at large distances
from a small system we're studying, then we can define a far-away boundary that surrounds the system,
measure the flux through that boundary, and find the system's charge.
For such \emph{asymptotic flatness}\index{asymptotic flatness} spacetimes, we
can also get around the problems that crop up with conserved vectors, such as
momentum. (Asymptotic flatness is discussed in more
detail in section \ref{subsubsec:asymptotic-flatness}.)\label{asymptotic-flatness-idea}
If the spacetime far away is nearly flat, then parallel transport loses its path-dependence,
so we can unambiguously define a notion of parallel-transporting all the contributions to the
flux to one arbitrarily chosen point P and then adding them. Asymptotic flatness also allows
us to define an approximate notion of a global Lorentz frame, so that the choice of P doesn't
matter.

% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:M87_jet.jpg

As an example, figure \figref{relativistic-jet} shows a jet of matter being ejected from the galaxy M87 at
ultrarelativistic fields. The blue color of the jet in the visible-light image comes from synchrotron radiation,
which is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by relativistic charged particles accelerated by a magnetic field.
The jet is believed to be coming from a supermassive black hole at the center of M87. The emission of the jet
in a particular direction suggests that the black hole is not spherically symmetric. It seems to have a particular
axis associated with it. How can this be? Our sun's spherical symmetry is broken by the existence of externally
observable features such as sunspots and the equatorial bulge, but the only information we can get about a black
hole comes from its external gravitational (and possibly electromagnetic) fields. It appears that something about
the spacetime metric surrounding this black hole breaks spherical symmetry, but preserves symmetry about some
preferred axis. What aspect of the initial conditions in the formation of the hole could have determined such an axis?
The most likely candidate is the angular momentum. We are thus led to suspect that black holes can possess angular
momentum, that angular momentum preserves information about their formation, and that angular momentum
is externally detectable via its effect on the spacetime metric.

What would the form of such a metric be? Spherical coordinates in flat spacetime give a metric
like this:
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = \der t^2 - \der r^2 - r^2 \der\theta^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta \der\phi^2\eqquad.
\end{equation*}
We'll see in chapter \ref{ch:vacuum} that for a non-rotating black hole, the metric is of the
form
\begin{equation*}
  \der s^2 = (\ldots)\der t^2 - (\ldots)\der r^2 - r^2 \der\theta^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta \der\phi^2\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $(\ldots)$ represents functions of $r$. In fact, there is nothing special about the metric of a black
hole, at least far away; the same external metric applies to \emph{any}
spherically symmetric, non-rotating body, such as the moon. Now what about the metric of a rotating body?
We expect it to have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It has terms that are odd under time-reversal, corresponding to reversal of the body's angular momentum.
\item Similarly, it has terms that are odd under reversal of the differential $\der\phi$ of the azimuthal coordinate.
\item The metric should have axial symmetry, i.e., it should be independent of $\phi$.
\end{enumerate}
Restricting our attention to the equatorial plane $\theta=\pi/2$,
the simplest modification that has these three properties is to add a term of the form
\begin{equation*}
  f(\ldots) L\der\phi\der t\eqquad,
\end{equation*}
where $(\ldots)$ again gives the $r$-dependence and $L$ is a constant, interpreted as the angular momentum.
A detailed treatment is beyond the scope of this book,
but solutions of this form to the relativistic field equations were found by
New Zealand-born physicist Roy Kerr in 1963 at the University of Texas at Austin.

The astrophysical modeling of observations like figure \figref{relativistic-jet} is complicated, but
we can see in a simplified thought experiment that if we want to determine the angular momentum of
a rotating body via its gravitational field, it will be difficult unless we use a measuring process that
takes advantage of the asymptotic flatness of the space. For example, suppose we send two beams of light past
the earth, in its equatorial plane, one on each side, and measure their deflections, \figref{frame-dragging-banana}. The
deflections will be different, because the sign of $\der\phi\der t$ will be opposite for the two beams.
But the entire notion of a ``deflection'' only makes sense if we have an asymptotically flat background,
as indicated by the dashed tangent lines. Also, if spacetime were not asymptotically flat in this example,
then there might be no unambiguous way to determine whether the asymmetry was due to the earth's rotation,
to some external factor, or to some kind of interaction between the earth and other bodies nearby.

It also turns out that a gyroscope in such a gravitational field precesses. This effect, called frame dragging, was predicted by
Lense and Thirring\index{Lense-Thirring effect}\index{frame dragging}
in 1918, and was finally verified experimentally in 2008 by analysis of data from the Gravity Probe B experiment,\index{Gravity Probe B!frame dragging}
to a precision of about 15\%. The experiment was arranged so that the relatively strong 
geodetic effect (6.6 arc-seconds per year) and the much weaker Lense-Thirring
effect (.041 arc-sec/yr) produced precessions in perpendicular directions.
Again, the presence of an asymptotically flat background was involved, because the probe measured the
orientations of its gyroscopes relative to the guide star IM Pegasi.

This section can be skipped on a first reading.
<% begin_sec("Area, volume, and tensor densities") %>
We've embarked on a program of redefining every possible physical quantity as a tensor, but so far we haven't tackled
area and volume. Is there, for example, an area tensor in a locally Euclidean plane? We are encouraged to hope that
there is such a thing, because on p.~\pageref{affine-area-and-volume} we saw that we could cook up a measure of
area with no other ingredients than the axioms of affine geometry. What kind of tensor would it be? The notions of vector and scalar from freshman
mechanics are distinguished from one another by the fact that one has a direction in space and the other does not. Therefore we expect that
area would be a scalar, i.e., a rank-0 tensor. But this can't be right, for the following reason. Under a rescaling of Cartesian coordinates by
a factor $k$, area should change by a factor of $k^2$. But by the tensor transformation laws, a rank-0 tensor is supposed to be
invariant under a change of coordinates. We therefore conclude that quantities like area and volume are not tensors.

In the language of ordinary vectors and scalars in Euclidean three-space, one way to express area and volume is by using
dot and cross products. The area of the parallelogram spanned by $\vc{u}$ and $\vc{v}$ is measured by the area vector $\vc{u}\times\vc{v}$,
and similarly the volume of the parallelepiped formed by  $\vc{u}$, $\vc{v}$, and $\vc{w}$ can be computed as the scalar triple product $\vc{u}\cdot(\vc{v}\times\vc{w})$. 
Both of these quantities are defined such that interchanging two of the inputs negates the output. In differential
geometry, we do have a scalar product, which is defined by contracting the indices of two vectors, as in $u^av_a$. If we also had a
a tensorial cross product, we would be able to define area and volume tensors, so we conclude that there is no tensorial cross product, i.e.,
an operation that would multiply two rank-1 tensors to produce a rank-1 tensor. Since one of the most important physical applications of
the cross product is to calculate the angular momentum $\vc{L}=\vc{r}\times\vc{p}$, we find that angular momentum in relativity is
either not a tensor or not a rank-1 tensor.

When someone tells you that it's impossible to do a seemingly straightforward thing, the typical response is to look for a way
to get around the supposed limitation. In the case of a locally Euclidean plane, what is to stop us from making a small, standard
square, and then sliding the square around to any desired location? If we have some figure whose area we wish to measure, we can
then dissect it into squares of that size and count the number of squares.

<%
  fig(
    'mobius-strip',
    %q{A M\"{o}bius strip is not an orientable surface.}
  )
%>
<% end_marg %>

There are two problems with this plan, neither of which is completely insurmountable. First, the area vector $\vc{u}\times\vc{v}$
is a vector, with its orientation specified by the direction of the normal to the surface. We need this orientation, for example, when we calculate
the electric flux as $\int \vc{E}\cdot\der\vc{A}$. Figure \figref{mobius-strip} shows that we cannot always define such an orientation
in a consistent way. When the $x-y$ coordinate system is slid around the M\"{o}bius strip, it ends up with the opposite orientation.
In general relativity, there is not any guarantee of orientability in space --- or even in time!\index{orientability} But the vast majority
of spacetimes of physical interest are in fact orientable in every desired way, and even for those that aren't, orientability still holds
in any sufficiently small neighborhood.

The other problem is that area has the wrong scaling properties to be a rank-0 tensor.
We can get around this problem by
being willing to discuss quantities that don't transform exactly like tensors. Often we only care about transformations, such as
rotations and translations, that don't involve
any scaling. We saw in 
section \ref{sec:lorentz-geometry} on p.~\pageref{sec:lorentz-geometry} that Lorentz boosts also have the special property of
preserving area in a space-time plane containing the boost.
We therefore define a \emph{tensor density}\index{tensor density} as a quantity that
transforms like a tensor under rotations, translations, and boosts,
but that rescales and possibly flips its sign under other types of
coordinate transformations. In general, the additional factor comes from
the determinant $d$ of the matrix consisting of the partial derivatives
$\partial x'^\mu/\partial x^\nu$ (called the Jacobian matrix).\index{Jacobian matrix}
This determinant is raised to a power
$W$, known as the weight of the tensor density.\index{weight of a tensor density} Weight
zero corresponds to the case of a real tensor. The definition of the sign of $W$ is not standardized in the
literature. The convention in this book is the one used by Carroll and Weinberg, but the opposite sign is

\begin{eg}{Area as a tensor density}
In a Euclidean plane, making our rulers shorter by a factor of $k$ causes the area measured in the new coordinates
to increase by a factor of $k^2$. The rescaling is represented by a matrix of partial
derivatives that is simply $kI$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. The determinant is $k^2$. Therefore
area is a tensor density of weight $+1$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Mass density}
A piece of aluminum foil as a certain number of milligrams per square centimeter.
Shrinking rulers by $1/k$ causes this number to decrease by $k^{-2}$, so this mass density has $W=-1$.

In Weyl's apt characterization,\footnote{Hermann Weyl, ``Space-Time-Matter,'' 1922, p.~109, available online at \url{archive.org/details/spacetimematter00weyluoft}.} 
tensors represent intensities, while tensor densities measure quantity.
<% end_sec %> % Area, volume, and tensor densities
<% begin_sec("The Levi-Civita symbol") %>\index{angular momentum}
Although there is no tensorial vector cross product, we can define a similar operation whose output is a tensor density.
This is most easily expressed in terms of the Levi-Civita symbol\index{Levi-Civita, Tullio}\index{Levi-Civita symbol} $\epsilon$.
(See p.~\pageref{fig:levi-civita-portrait} for biographical information about Levi-Civita.)

In $n$ dimensions, the Levi-Civita symbol has $n$ indices. It is defined so as to
be totally asymmetric, in the sense that if any two of the indices are interchanged, its sign flips. This is sufficient
to define the symbol completely except for an over-all scaling, which is fixed by arbitrarily taking one of the nonvanishing
elements and setting it to $+1$. To see that this is enough to define $\epsilon$ completely, first note that it must vanish
when any index is repeated. For example, in three dimensions labeled by $\kappa$, $\lambda$, and $\mu$, $\epsilon_{\kappa\lambda\lambda}$
is unchanged under an interchange of the second and third indices, but it must also flip its sign under this operation, which means
that it must be zero. If we arbitrarily fix $\epsilon_{\kappa\lambda\mu}=+1$, then interchange of the second and third indices
gives $\epsilon_{\kappa\mu\lambda}=-1$, and a further interchange of the first and second yields $\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}=+1$.
Any permutation of the three distinct indices can be reached from any other by a series of such pairwise swaps, and the number
of swaps is uniquely odd or even.\footnote{For a proof, see the Wikipedia article ``Parity of a permutation.''}
In Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions, it is conventional to choose  $\epsilon_{xyz}=+1$ when
$x$, $y$, and $z$ form a right-handed spatial coordinate system. In four dimensions, we take
$\epsilon_{txyz}=+1$ when $t$ is future-timelike and $(x,y,z)$ are right-handed.

In Euclidean three-space, in coordinates such that $g=\operatorname{diag}(1,1,1)$, the vector cross product $\vc{A}=\vc{u}\times\vc{v}$, where we have
in mind the interpretation of $\vc{A}$ as area, can be expressed
as $A_\mu=\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}u^\kappa v^\lambda$.

Self-check: Check that this matches up with the more familiar definition of the vector cross product.

Now suppose that we want to generalize to curved spaces, where $g$ cannot be constant. There are two ways to proceed.

<% begin_sec("Tensorial $\\epsilon$") %>
One is to let $\epsilon$ have the values $0$ and $\pm1$ at some arbitrarily chosen point, in some arbitrarily chosen coordinate
system, but to let it transform like a tensor. Then $A_\mu=\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}u^\kappa v^\lambda$ needs to be modified,
since the right-hand side is a tensor, and that would make $A$ a tensor, but if $A$ is an area we don't want it to transform like
a 1-tensor. We therefore need to revise the definition of area to be $A_\mu=g^{-1/2}\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}u^\kappa v^\lambda$,
where $g$ is the determinant of the lower-index form of the metric. The following two examples justify this procedure in a locally Euclidean three-space.

\begin{eg}{Scaling coordinates with tensorial $\epsilon$}
Then scaling of coordinates by $k$ scales all the elements of the metric by $k^{-2}$, $g$ by $k^{-6}$, $g^{-1/2}$ by $k^{3}$, $\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}$ by
$k^{-3}$, and $u^\kappa v^\lambda$ by $k^2$. The result is to scale $A_\mu$ by $k^{+3-3+2}=k^{2}$, which makes sense if $A$ is an area.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}{Oblique coordinates with tensorial $\epsilon$}
In oblique coordinates (example \ref{eg:oblique-cartesian}, p.~\pageref{eg:oblique-cartesian}), the two basis vectors have unit
length but are at an angle $\phi \ne \pi/2$ to one another. The determinant of the metric is $g=\sin^2\phi$, so $\sqrt{g}=\sin\phi$,
which is exactly the correction factor needed in order to get the right area when $u$ and $v$ are the two basis vectors.
\end{eg}

This procedure works more generally, the sole modification being that in a space such as a locally Lorentzian one where $g<0$ we need
to use $\sqrt{-g}$ as the correction factor rather than $\sqrt{g}$.
<% end_sec %> % Tensorial $\epsilon$
<% begin_sec("Tensor-density $\\epsilon$") %>
The other option is to let $\epsilon$ have the same $0$ and $\pm1$ values at all points. Then $\epsilon$ is clearly not a tensor, because
it doesn't scale by a factor of $k^n$ when the coordinates are scaled by $k$; $\epsilon$ is a tensor density with weight $-1$ for the upper-index version
and $+1$ for the lower-index one. The relation $A_\mu=\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}u^\kappa v^\lambda$ gives an area that is a tensor density,
not a tensor, because $A$ is not written in terms of purely tensorial quantities. Scaling the coordinates by $k$ leaves $\epsilon_{\mu\kappa\lambda}$
unchanged, scales up $u^\kappa v^\lambda$ by $k^2$, and scales up the area by $k^2$, as expected.
<% end_sec %> % Tensor-density $\epsilon$

Unfortunately, there is no consistency in the literature as to whether $\epsilon$ should be a tensor or a tensor density.
Some authors define both a tensor and a nontensor version, with notations
like $\epsilon$ and $\tilde{\epsilon}$, or\footnote{Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler} $\epsilon_{0123}$ and $[0123]$. 
Others avoid writing the letter $\epsilon$ completely.\footnote{Hawking and Ellis} The tensor-density version
is convenient because we always know that its value is $0$ or $\pm 1$. The tensor version has the advantage that it transforms
as a tensor.

<% begin_sec("Spacetime volume") %>\index{volume!spacetime}\label{subsec:spacetime-volume}
We saw on p.~\pageref{spacetime-area} that area in the $1+1$-dimensional plane of flat spacetime is preserved 
by a Lorentz boost. This makes sense because when we express the area spanned by a parallelogram with edges
$\vc{p}$ and $\vc{q}$ as
$\epsilon^{ab}p_as_b$, all the indices have been contracted, leaving a rank-0 tensor density. In $3+1$ dimensions,
we have the spacetime volume $V=\epsilon^{abcd}p_a q_b r_c s_d$ spanned by the paralellepiped with edges
$\vc{p}$, $\vc{q}$, $\vc{r}$, and $\vc{s}$. A typical situation in which this volume is nonzero would be that in which
one of the vectors is timelike and the other three spacelike.
Let the timelike one be $\vc{p}$. Assume $|\vc{p}|= 1$, since an example with $|\vc{p}|\ne 1$ can be reduced to this
by scaling. Then $\vc{p}$ can be interpreted as the velocity vector of some observer, and
$V$ as the spatial volume that the observer says is spanned by the 
3-paralellepiped with edges $\vc{q}$, $\vc{r}$, and $\vc{s}$.
<% end_sec %> % 
<% begin_sec("Angular momentum") %>\index{angular momentum}
As discussed above, angular momentum cannot be a rank-1 tensor.
One approach is to define a rank-2 angular momentum tensor $L^{ab}=r^ap^b-r^bp^a$. 

In a frame whose origin is instantaneously moving along with a certain system's center of mass
at a certain time, the time-space components of $L$ vanish, and the components $L^{yz}$, $L^{zx}$, and $L^{xy}$ coincide
in the nonrelativistic limit with the $x$, $y$, and $z$ components of the Newtonian angular momentum vector. 
We can also define a three-dimensional object
$L^a=\epsilon_{abc}L^{bc}$ (with three-dimensional tensor-density $\epsilon$ in the spatial dimensions) that
doesn't transform like a tensor.
